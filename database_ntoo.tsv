I have lost count of the number of time I’ve been told how “stretch opportunities” (such as acting up, secondments, and involvement in significant projects) which are the key to career progression have been filled by a tap on the shoulder followed by promotion. 	https://mdxminds.com/2021/09/16/no-more-tick-boxes/

Sadly, this has made many apps much less usable with screen readers such as orca.

This came from years of their own experiences. They got into Linux much more than me, and even compiled their own kernel. Well, this looks like a member of the Gnome Foundation's response to their thread. No, I'm not going to link the blind person here because they don't need anymore bullshit from fossbros. I mean, calling their heart-felt posts a "trauma dump", and that they're "making up shit on the spot", isn't it time that we've had enough of these ableist people? Developers who are indifferent to people with disabilities will definitely see this, and the Gnome folks probably see this kind of talk all the time, that "we can't do this," or "We don't have the time or money," and that kind of talk makes itself true. Accessibility will not move forward with this kind of mentality at the head of one of the most popular Linux desktops. Can we get a little solidarity here? This Gnome foundation person is attacking a blind, nonbinary, Gendervoid person, and I'm sick of this shit going unnoticed. I want you Linux users to think about this. Think about the people who sit there in power. It doesn't take all kinds of people to make a community. Some people aren't just "a little rough around the edges." We need a community of empathetic people that do not punch down.	https://tweesecake.social/@devinprater/110520083513266265

6/12/2023 21:47:53	Tower lockdown breached human rights, Ombudsman finds	he timing of the lockdown of North Melbourne and Flemington public housing towers on July 4 was not based on direct health advice and violated Victorian human rights laws, an investigation by the Victorian Ombudsman has found.   Ombudsman Deborah Glass said her investigation found that senior health officials agreed on the morning of Saturday, July 4 that the towers should be locked down to control a COVID-19 outbreak, anticipating a next-day start to allow planning for food supplies and other logistics. But at a media conference at 4pm the Premier announced the lockdown, starting immediately.  Ms Glass said the investigation found the immediate start appeared traceable to a Crisis Council of Cabinet meeting at 1.45pm that afternoon. The Ombudsman’s request for documents from the Cabinet meeting, which are subject to privilege, was denied.  She has recommended the Victorian Government apologise to the tower residents, acknowledging the impact of their immediate detention on their health and wellbeing.  "Many residents knew nothing of the lockdown or the reason for it when large numbers of police appeared on their estate that afternoon," Ms Glass said.  "We heard that initially there was chaos. Some people were without food and medicines. At the tower at 33 Alfred St, the focus of the investigation, residents waited more than a week to be allowed outside under supervision for fresh air.”  "Since March, restrictions on movement both broad and specific have been issued many times in Victoria, but never before or since without warning," Ms Glass said.  Ms Glass said the lockdown was lifted at eight of the nine towers after five days, but residents at 33 Alfred St, where infection rates were highest, were detained for another nine days.  The investigation found a temporary lockdown was warranted and successfully contained the outbreak, but that its immediacy was not based on direct public health advice.  "The rushed lockdown was not compatible with the residents' human rights, including their right to humane treatment when deprived of liberty. In my opinion, based on the evidence gathered by the investigation, the action appeared to be contrary to the law."	https://www.ombudsman.vic.gov.au/our-impact/news/public-housing-tower-lockdown/

The Victorian government has settled a class action over measures intended to stop an outbreak of the virus in nine towers at the height of the second wave.  About 3000 residents lived in the Flemington and North Melbourne towers at the time of the lockdown, which led to police surrounding buildings and temporary fences being set up.  The plaintiffs claim people were wrongly detained for up to 14 days and threatened with physical harm if they tried to leave the towers, though the state of Victoria denied those claims.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/09/melbourne-public-housing-tower-residents-win-5m-payout-over-covid-lockdown

I didn't dare turn around to look at my parents' facial expressions, in case they would realise that I too was "a homosexual". I'd recently developed a crush on the actor Elijah Wood, and this was all the evidence I needed to know that my infatuations with male stars should remain a forbidden subject.	https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230608-how-families-can-support-lgbt-teens

(For example, the word “PRINT” would be pronounced not as one syllable but as “P-R-I-N-T.”)  Nonetheless, this was a game changer. Henter could perform his job without any assistance. When the next version — one that could read a word at a time — came out, Henter regularly called the company for tech support and became the most known user. Blazie, the head of the company — who would go down in history as one of the few sighted pioneers of the assistive technology industry — soon offered him a job. 	https://www.theverge.com/23203911/screen-readers-history-blind-henter-curran-teh-nvda

It is sad to read that students are resigned to the likelihood that nothing will be done if they report a racial incident, so they don’t bother. Instead, they internalise the humiliation and prepare for a career where discrimination is commonplace, no doubt affecting their self esteem and their ability to perform. Action needed to close the attainment gap is in the gift of the GMC. To move things forward, the BMA has launched a charter for medical schools and guidance for students “to prevent and effectively deal with racial harassment.”	https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m568

Blacks comprise 13% of the US population but roughly one quarter of COVID-19 deaths and are nearly four times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to whites (94·2 vs 24·8 deaths per 100 000). Blacks across all age groups are nearly three times more likely than white people to contract COVID-19. These numbers, while striking, are not surprising and mirror well-documented patterns of morbidity and mortality across a wide range of health outcomes that have been observed in the USA for decades. Experts contend that “racism and not race” is the primary driver of these inequities with many citing “interlocking systems of racism” that have converged to increase exposure, transmission, and death among Blacks. These systems—from healthcare, to housing, to the carceral state—are all rooted in an ideology of white supremacy and the institution of slavery that dates back over 400 years and are maintained by racist policies and practices that construct and reinforce inequitable access to power and resources.	https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30567-3/fulltext
6/16/2023 7:16:30	Mistreated Victorian mental health patients should be given compensation and a public apology, report finds - ABC News	The Victorian government has been accused of trying to force changes to an independent report into the trauma caused by compulsory mental health treatment, with the author claiming he was threatened by department officials.  Last year mental health consultant Simon Katterl, who has lived experience, was contracted by the Department of Health to provide advice to the mental health minister about the impact of compulsory mental health treatments on patients.  The report found that Victorians who had suffered "gross human rights violations" during mental health treatment against their will should be offered financial redress by the state with a full public apology from the government.  Some people who had a mental illness were subjected to compulsory treatment that included seclusion, restraint and coercive treatment including the use of induced comas.	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-06-13/mental-health-mistreatment-calls-for-redress-apology/102468454?utm_campaign=abc_news_web&utm_content=twitter&utm_medium=content_shared&utm_source=abc_news_web

The Nobel Prize and Fields Medal experience	I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops  (Stephen Jay Gould, 1980)  Opportunities in science largely affect the accumulation of scientific knowledge and, therefore, technological change. However, there is little evidence of how much of people’s talent is actually wasted. Here we focus on scientists with the highest performance, the recipients of the Nobel Prize and Fields Medal. We found that the average age of scientists at the time of the breakthrough was higher for researchers from less developed countries. Moreover, individual opportunities in the world were extremely unequal by country of birth, gender significantly conditioned any participation in research, and the probability of becoming a top researcher more than doubled for individuals with parents belonging to the most favoured occupational categories. 	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04236-y

Then he’d criticise me in front of my colleagues and accuse me of not following instructions, even though I had.”    Diane says, at some point, her manager started making fun of her in front of her team members for everything from what she ate for lunch, to the occasional typo in an email. Today, Diane still works for the same boss. Even though she says things have improved slightly – which she attributes to the team adding heads – she says she still feels “harassed”.	https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230615-why-its-getting-harder-for-some-women-to-report-harassment

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed to differentiate between AI and human-generated content, the fairness and robustness of these detectors remain underexplored. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several widely-used GPT detectors using writing samples from native and non-native English writers. Our findings reveal that these detectors consistently misclassify non-native English writing samples as AI-generated, whereas native writing samples are accurately identified. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple prompting strategies can not only mitigate this bias but also effectively bypass GPT detectors, suggesting that GPT detectors may unintentionally penalize writers with constrained linguistic expressions. Our results call for a broader conversation about the ethical implications of deploying ChatGPT content detectors and caution against their use in evaluative or educational settings, particularly when they may inadvertently penalize or exclude non-native English speakers from the global discourse.	https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819

But last month, the Government reduced the size of the fortnightly supplement from $550 to $250 (and the $250 payment could disappear completely on December 31).  It was against the advice of social policy experts and economists, ostensibly done to ween people off the emergency-level payment and encourage people to start looking for work again.  The decision pushed 370,000 people back into poverty, according to modelling from The Australia Institute.	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-04/coronavirus-government-policy-jobkeeper-jobseeker-unemployment/12729136

The blog posts, written years before he was in the public eye, contain disturbing insights into the worldview which has shaped his politics, and even brought him convictions for 'disturbing religious worship' and 'ethnic agitation' for which he was fined by the Finnish Supreme Court.   Among hundreds of blog posts over the years, Halla-aho wrote in June 2006 that Islam is a "religion of pedophiles," and the Prophet Mohammed "was a pedophile."  He said that "robbing passers-by" was a "genetic trait" of Somalis.   In 2006 he implied he would be "exclusively happy if a 'gang of immigrants' raped" a Green party MP.   "I still and will continue to sincerely and wholeheartedly believe that if a woman who opposes the deportation of immigrant rapists is raped by an immigrant rapist, it is a happy thing," he later wrote.	https://www.euronews.com/2023/06/20/racism-and-rape-fantasies-the-pr-headache-facing-finlands-new-right-wing-government

The law, which one of its sponsors in the Texas state Senate called the most significant ban on diversity offices in higher education in the country, comes as the U.S. Supreme Court later this month is widely expected to ban colleges and universities from considering race as a factor in their admissions decisions.  Under the Texas law, signed by Abbott on Wednesday, any public college or university that does not certify it is in compliance with the measure would not be able to spend state funds allocated to it.  It also mandates that state officials every two years through 2029 conduct studies to gauge the impact of the law on students broken down by race. It will look at the rates of application, acceptance, matriculations, retention and graduation, along with grade point averages. The law does not explain the reasoning for conducting these studies.	https://www-nbcnews-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna89694

Medically, Shamshirsaz knew what the right course of action was, but legally, there was nothing he could do. He sent her home, telling her to return if she developed a fever or chills.   When a few days later, the woman came back, she was in severe danger. She had developed septic shock, a condition that involves extremely low blood pressure, mental confusion and, in some cases, organ failure and death. They cared for her in the intensive care unit for two weeks. Shamshirsaz said the infection was so severe that the patient’s kidneys suffered permanent damage. She would require an organ transplant within a year or so to stay alive.  All of this, he knew, could have been avoided if the patient had been able to get an abortion when she came in the first time.

He said the Greek coastguard was towing the vessel when it sank in one of the deepest parts of the Mediterranean, about 80km (50 miles) off the coast of Greece.  The Greek authorities have previously denied this, claiming that when they tried to tie a rope to the boat to come aboard and assess the situation, people on board tried to remove it, saying they wanted to travel on to Italy.  But a Syrian survivor told us: "They towed the boat from the side and moved with speed." This tallies with the account of the Egyptian man, who said the coastguard "forcibly pulled us, causing the trawler to capsize".	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66073307

Its title is ‘Residential Segregation and Unequal Access to Local Public Services in India: Evidence from 1.5m Neighborhoods’. It was done by Sam Asher, Kritarth Jha, Paul Novosad, Anjali Adukia, and Brandon Tan.

This had the paradoxical effect of making the gay Black male candidate more desirable as a candidate (to White people) than the heterosexual Black male candidate. Thus, being gay functioned as a “disarming mechanism” similar to the Teddy Bear Effect, which shows that babyfaced Black men have an advantage because they appear warmer and more docile.	https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertwlivingston_pride-pridemonth-lgbtq-activity-7077639316293734403-vqRe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android

So they have very little available to pay for rent and have enough money left over for all of life's other necessities.

Rather than abide by its treaties, which the US constitution calls the “supreme law of the land”, the federal government allowed gold prospectors and settlers to overrun the Black Hills and surrounding area.  Members of the Great Sioux Nation were forced to surrender most of their territory and move to much smaller reservations on what was deemed useless land by the US government. Decades later, the busts of four US presidents – two slave owners and two who were hostile toward Native Americans – were chiseled into the holy mountain the Lakota called “Tunkasila Sakpe”, the Six Grandfathers.	https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/03/mount-rushmore-south-dakota-indigenous-americans

While the players conducted their on-court warm-ups, drunken fans unleashed some racially fueled heckles at the Globetrotters. According to the book Sport: Race, Ethnicity and Identity, point guard Runt Pullins huddled the team together and suggested that the best way to shut up "these wise guys" was to absolutely dominate and embarrass the local team they had to play that night.   And that's what they did, running up the score to a ridiculous 112 to 5. That only angered the crowd more, and to pacify the increasingly raucous and possibly violent fans in the stands, the team calmed them down with basketball tricks. Runt Pullins smiled as he dribbled the ball between his legs, Inman Jackson threw a pass behind his back to Kid Oliver, who tossed up the ball and caught it on his neck, then rolled it down his arm. From that night on, coach Abe Saperstein told players to incorporate the tricks into the games, particularly as it could settle down audiences uncomfortable and hostile to the notion of a dominant team of African-Americans.	https://www.grunge.com/200929/the-untold-truth-of-the-harlem-globetrotters/

Women are treated as "subordinate" to men at all levels of the sport. There is a prevalence of "elitism and class-based discrimination" in cricket. Black cricket has been failed and the ECB must develop a plan to revive it. Many who experience discrimination do not report it because of a distrust in the authorities. Umpires regularly ignore abuse and dismiss complaints in both the professional and recreational games. "There remains a stark reality that cricket is not a 'game for everyone' and it is absolutely essential that the work required to achieve that ambition must begin immediately," wrote ICEC chair Cindy Butts.	https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/66022949

	studentactivism	Lewis had written that "For the first time in one hundred years this nation is being awakened to the fact that segregation is evil and that it must be destroyed in all forms. Your presence today proves that you have been aroused to the point of action."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284488468115193856
	studentactivism	Next, Lewis went on to condemn the bill for not including voting rights protections. "As it stands now," his elders added, but that wouldn't be changed before the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964. Voting would have to wait for the Voting Rights Act the following year.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284487271576752128
	studentactivism	"Of," on the other hand, is both tempered and ambiguous—the fear of a police state is a fear of something external, and maybe even hypothetical. A tiny change, but one that carries incredible weight.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284486556351430656
	studentactivism	Of all the changes Lewis had foisted on him that day, that one is maybe the most fascinating to me. "In a police state" is an emphatic statement about lived conditions, explicitly naming what it meant, what it was, to be Black in the Jim Crow South.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284486088799780864
	studentactivism	Lewis' elders had him change "the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear in a police state" to "...must live in constant fear OF a police state."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284484917242601472
	studentactivism	Danville had been the site of ongoing civil rights demonstrations and boycotts that spring and summer, and the city government had reacted brutally—beating protesters, many of them high school students, using fire hoses on them, cramming them into overcrowded jails.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284484686845284353
	studentactivism	Next, Lewis had written that the Kennedy civil rights bill ("in its present form" in the final version) would not "protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear in a police state."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284484585775079425
	studentactivism	And right after that, a line referring to the bill's failure to "protect young children and old women from police dogs and fire hoses" had the words "in the South" added to it.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284480377025961984
	studentactivism	Why didn't Lewis support the civil rights act "wholeheartedly"? Well, this line, appearing immediately after the one above, gives an indication: "There’s not one thing in the bill that will protect our people from police brutality." That line was struck entirely.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284479954474991618
	studentactivism	The first problem came in the speech's second sentence, where Lewis said the movement couldn't fully support JFK's civil rights bill, because it was "too little, too late." That got changed to "we support it with great reservation."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284479340202332160
	studentactivism	In the end, the group negotiated more than a dozen significant changes to the speech, each of which moderated its tone and substance and many of which have particular resonance today. The final typed version was completed just moments before Lewis took the stage.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284477363288510464
	studentactivism	John Lewis was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington—where MLK gave the "I have a dream" speech—and the speech Lewis wrote that day was so incendiary that the march organizers wouldn't let him deliver it as written.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284472208006545408

	KGuilaine	But let me break this down a bit more, for some of y’all when it comes to the mental health of Black & Brown groups, there ARE serious gaps, full stop. All so called ‘evidence based’ models are primarily tested on young white folks, disproportionately students.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277324689627582465
	KGuilaine	1) Be very very cautious of those who claim there is little by way of *evidence*, that my friend is RACISM. Black scholars in particular have been writing about racial trauma for over 100 years, detailing the struggles & resistance...the arrogance of discounting such knowledge!	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277319722594439176
	drcbond	Silence for me, has always proved far more violent than speaking. I speak not because I’m a trouble-maker, I speak because I refuse to accept the role of victim and all that comes with it. https://t.co/Gc8QghEl55	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277195548412407808
	KGuilaine	And that is why white deference is still a thing within community of colour. Do you think you can kill, mutilate, torture, lynch a group people for speaking FOR CENTURIES and think that fear if not terror of speaking will leave no trace?	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277196512393658368
	KGuilaine	I hear this. There structural consequences for those who speak, essentially as @thetwerkinggirl wrote so powerfully, financial & economic abuse is the core weapon of white supremacy. Your silence is often traded for your ability to feed yourself and your family, for way too many.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277194415178747905
	NITV	Two emerging critics stepped aside from their newly appointed roles with Nine Entertainment this week in a show of solidarity with calls to increase representation of people of colour in Australia's media landscape. https://t.co/xEH7lKbmJy @nadine_silva_ reports.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277044043244023808
	KGuilaine	One thing we need to discuss is trauma lies at the core of assimilation politics.   And silence is the cost of assimilation.  Thus silence is also a consequence of racial & intergenerational trauma. Silence is the price you have to pay to enjoy them comfort of the masters’ house.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277191852333191169

	helpmeskeletor	Or how ‘we consulted WOC’ morphs into several different positions. It speaks to the disposability of who they consult with.

	helpmeskeletor	It’s been interesting seeing them pivoting from ‘we consulted with WOC’ to ‘we are blocking Asians’.

	Race-Related Differences in Promotions and Support: Underlying Effects of Human and Social Capital	This study examined two alternative explanations for disparity in reported work-related experiences and outcomes between black and white managers: treatment discrimination because of race, and differences in human and social capital. Education and training, representing human capital, and racial similarity of network ties and proportion of strong ties, representing social capital, were used to predict whether human and social capital would mediate the relationship between race and the work-related experiences and outcomes under investigation. Results of a survey of black and white managers in a Fortune 500 financial services firm indicate that black managers reported a slower rate of promotion and less psychosocial support than white managers. Race had both a direct and an indirect effect on these outcomes. Participation in company training significantly predicted reported promotion rates, but race remained a significant predictor. Additional analysis revealed that race moderates the relationship between human capital and promotion rate and suggests a type of treatment discrimination against blacks. Contrary to predictions, social capital did not predict promotion rate, although social capital mediated the relationship between race and psychosocial support. Black managers reported having less social capital than whites, and social capital, in turn, was positively related to the receipt of psychosocial support. No differences were found between blacks and whites in their receipt of career-related support.	https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640341

	When Blind Hiring Advances DEI - and When It Doesn't	As a decision-making strategy, "blind hiring" involves blocking evaluators from receiving potentially biasing information about a job candidate until after an evaluation of their application materials are complete. Most famously, the tactic was used to boost the hiring of women in orchestras by having people audition from behind a screen that concealed their gender. But there's a body of research that's been conducted since that 2000 study showing that, while the strategy is generally effective, there are situations in which it might not help you diversify your candidate pool. The author outlines this research, and suggests three questions you should ask in order to get the most out of a blind hiring approach.	https://hbr.org/2023/06/when-blind-hiring-advances-dei-and-when-it-doesnt

	Highlighting COVID-19 racial disparities can reduce support for safety precautions among White U.S. residents	U.S. media has extensively covered racial disparities in COVID-19 infections and deaths, which may ironically reduce public concern about COVID-19. In two preregistered studies (conducted in the fall of 2020), we examined whether perceptions of COVID-19 racial disparities predict White U.S. residents' attitudes toward COVID-19. Utilizing a correlational design (N¬†=¬†498), we found that those who perceived COVID-19 racial disparities to be greater reported reduced fear of COVID-19, which predicted reduced support for COVID-19 safety precautions. In Study 2, we manipulated exposure to information about COVID-19 racial disparities (N¬†=¬†1,505). Reading about the persistent inequalities that produced COVID-19 racial disparities reduced fear of COVID-19, empathy for those vulnerable to COVID-19, and support for safety precautions. These findings suggest that publicizing racial health disparities has the potential to create a vicious cycle wherein raising awareness reduces support for the very policies that could protect public health and reduce disparities.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795362200257X

	State-level macro-economic factors moderate the association of low income with brain structure and mental health in U.S. children	Macrostructural characteristics, such as cost of living and state-level anti-poverty programs relate to the magnitude of socioeconomic disparities in brain development and mental health. In this study we leveraged data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study from 10,633 9-11 year old youth (5115 female) across 17 states. Lower income was associated with smaller hippocampal volume and higher internalizing psychopathology. These associations were stronger in states with higher cost of living. However, in high cost of living states that provide more generous cash benefits for low-income families, socioeconomic disparities in hippocampal volume were reduced by 34%, such that the association of family income with hippocampal volume resembled that in the lowest cost of living states. We observed similar patterns for internalizing psychopathology. State-level anti-poverty programs and cost of living may be confounded with other factors related to neurodevelopment and mental health. However, the patterns were robust to controls for numerous state-level social, economic, and political characteristics. These findings suggest that state-level macrostructural characteristics, including the generosity of anti-poverty policies, are potentially relevant for addressing the relationship of low income with brain development and mental health.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37778-1

	Net effects: examining strategies for women's inclusion and influence in ASX200 company boards	Conventional approaches to improving the representation of women on the boards of major companies typically focus on increasing the number of women appointed to these positions. We show that this strategy alone does not improve gender equity. Instead of relying on aggregate statistics ("headcounts") to evaluate women's inclusion, we use network analysis to identify and examine two types of influence in corporate board networks: local influence measured by degree centrality and global influence measured by betweenness centrality and k-core centrality. Comparing board membership data from Australia's largest 200 listed companies in the ASX200 index in 2015 and 2018 respectively, we demonstrate that despite an increase in the number of women holding board seats during this time, their agency in terms of these network measures remains substantively unchanged. We argue that network analysis offers more nuanced approaches to measuring women's inclusion in organizational networks and will facilitate more successful outcomes for gender diversity and equity.	https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-022-00490-y

	Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders?	Why are so few women in management positions? The popular explanations range from women just aren't capable of being leaders to women just don't want to be leaders. According to the author, however, the absence of women in leadership roles has less to do with women themselves and more to do with how we interpret leadership traits. Confidence - a trait more associated with men - is often misinterpreted as competence. As a result, charismatic, but incompetent men have fewer barriers to reach the top than women. Individuals in positions to promote and hire managers should think more critically about what seems like a leadership trait versus what is an actual leadership trait. They will find that arrogance and overconfidence - the characteristics that get men into management positions - are also the characteristics that cause poor performance.	https://hbr.org/2013/08/why-do-so-many-incompetent-men

	Why call me that?' Reflections on labels in a diverse nation	Born from the realisation that labels as they relate to cultural communities are limited, this insightful essay considers use of the term 'Culturally and Linguistically Diverse' (CALD) and whether it's still the most meaningful way to describe and measure our diversity. ¬† Using real stories, Prentice exposes the tensions individuals face and the power of choice when it comes to labelling and describing oneself. She highlights the complexity associated with cultural identity and the difficulty in reducing what is personal, layered and nuanced to a single label. ¬† In the context of an increasingly diverse country, the author seeks to generate discussion by questioning whether the term CALD is still serving the purpose for which it was intended.	https://scanloninstitute.org.au/publications/essays/reflections-on-labels

	Lucy Salani	Lucy Salani (12 August 1924 - 22 March 2023) was an Italian activist and the only known Italian transgender person to have survived the Nazi concentration camps.Born in Fossano and raised in Bologna, Salani was understood to be a homosexual man before undergoing gender reassignment surgery later in her life. An anti-fascist, she deserted both the fascist Italian and the Nazi German armies during World War II, before getting caught and deported to the Dachau concentration camp in 1944, where she remained until the liberation of the camp by the American troops in April 1945. Following her liberation and the end of the war, Salani lived in Rome, Turin and Paris, before completing her transition in London. She then returned to Bologna in the 1980s, eventually spending the rest of her life in the city.  Salani's life story gained public attention during the 2010s, as writer and director Gabriella Romano dedicated a biography and a documentary to her.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Salani&oldid=1154533138

	Academics of colour in elite universities in the UK and the USA: the 'unspoken system of exclusion'	This article explores the experiences of academics of colour in elite universities in the UK and the USA. Drawing on interviews with 34 respondents and using a critical race theory perspective, the findings indicate that academics of colour experience racism in the White space of an elite university. To counter the racism they experience, they develop 'safe spaces' in which they find empathy and support from other academics of colour. A key finding from the study suggests that despite having negative experiences in elite universities, academics of colour have contradictory feelings about their positions. They disassociate themselves from the racism by recognising the status and prestige associated with working at an elite university. This article suggests that in order for academics of colour to be fully included in elite universities, institutions must acknowledge racism and their own Whiteness to work towards cultural change.	https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2021.2020746
	Push for a Royal Commission into 'robo-NDIS'	The Royal Commission into Robodebt heard significant revelations about the series of failures that led up to the illegal tech-based scheme.¬†Robodebt involved the use of an algorithm to average out a welfare recipient's yearly income using data from the tax office cross-matched with income reported to Centrelink. If the system identified a discrepancy, a "please explain" notice was sent to the recipient, with the onus placed on them to prove the debt didn't exist.¬†The system was found to regularly incorrectly match this data and create debts that were inaccurate or did not exist at all. The scheme was eventually found to be unlawful, with the federal government agreeing to refund $720 million debts, scrap $400 million in debts and provide $112 million in compensation.¬†The Royal Commission has held hearings this year to investigate the scheme and how similar failures can be prevented in the future.	https://www.innovationaus.com/push-for-a-royal-commission-into-robo-ndis/

	Is there a glass ceiling for ethnic minorities to enter leadership positions? Evidence from a field experiment with over 12,000 job applications	We conducted a field experiment to analyze if there is a glass ceiling for ethnic minorities entering leadership positions in organizations. We submitted over 12,000 job applications, to over 4,000 job advertisements, to investigate hiring discrimination against six ethnic groups for leadership positions. Drawing on implicit leadership theory, we argue that ethnic discrimination is particularly pronounced in the recruitment of leadership positions. The results confirm this hypothesis. For leadership positions, applicants with English names received 26.8% of positive responses for their job applications, while applicants with non-English names received 11.3% of positive responses. This means ethnic minorities received 57.4% fewer positive responses than applicants with English names for leadership positions despite identical resumes. For non-leadership positions, applicants with English names received 21.2% of positive responses for their job applications, while applicants with non-English names received 11.6% of positive responses. This means ethnic minorities received 45.3% fewer positive responses for non-leadership positions despite identical resumes. Ethnic discrimination for leadership positions was even more pronounced when the advertised job required customer contact. In contrast, hiring discrimination for leadership positions was not significantly influenced by whether the job advertisement emphasized individualism or learning, creativity, and innovation. Our findings provide novel evidence of a glass ceiling for ethnic minorities to enter leadership positions.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984322000583

	Erfurt latrine disaster	The Erfurt latrine disaster occurred on 26 July 1184, when Henry VI, King of Germany (later Holy Roman Emperor), held a Hoftag (informal assembly) in the Petersberg Citadel in Erfurt. On the morning of 26 July, the combined weight of the assembled nobles caused the wooden second story floor of the building to collapse and most of them fell through into the latrine cesspit below the ground floor, where about 60 of them drowned in liquid excrement. This event is called the Erfurter Latrinensturz (lit.‚Äâ'Erfurt latrine fall') in several German sources.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erfurt_latrine_disaster&oldid=1141657178

	Ditsy is 19 years-old and homeless in Salt Lake City. All the kids in this video are homeless!	Ditsy is 19 years-old and homeless in Salt Lake City, Utah. As you'll quickly see, Ditsy loves kids. He told me that helping and playing with the homeless kids in the park makes him feel better about his younger years. Although this was a fun interview, the fact that every kid in this video is homeless is a serious tragedy.     Ditsy says being a homeless youth is not the hardest thing he has done, but it's also not the easiest. He says he struggles for food, and has to worry about police when sleeping. As hard as homelessness is, Ditsy says if you can stay optimistic, it becomes a little easier. Smart words for such a young man.     When I started to talk to Ditsy about sharing his story the kids were not really around. Before I knew it the kids became part of this story so I just ran with it. While recording, I kept thinking about the challenges of finding all the parents to get their permission. This was a public park at dusk, and who knows where everyone is.     Ditsy took me to the first mother and I handed her a business card. I give everyone a business card with my email and cell number. The mother didn't really say much when another woman, surrounded by a group of people, started to yell at me to come to her. The first mother ran to this woman and handed her my business card. My first thoughts were that I was in trouble. My second thought was that no way was I going to get permission and this whole thing is about to go bad.     To my shock, the woman asked me to take photos of all their kids and family portraits of everyone. There were probably 3 or maybe 4 homeless families hanging out, and they all wanted portraits. I am not a still photographer and my gear is all setup for video. It was dark, I didn't have lights, and I had the wrong lens. I only say that because I wish I could have done better for all of them. I told them I would let me friends at Help Portrait [http://help-portrait.com] know what shelter they are in so they can get photos done right.     For the next 45 minutes I had so much fun, and so did all of them posing for photos. It was as if the world was alright and none of them were experimenting homelessness. Here is a link to a few of the family portraits I took tonight http://hardlynormal.tumblr.com/post/5... So obviously, not only did I get every parents permission I made a bunch of new friends in the process. It's a night I'll never forget that's for sure.

	Interplay of diversity, inclusion, and politics: Impact on employee well-being	Workforce diversity literature highlights adverse effects of surface diversity on employee affect. We examine the applicability of surface diversity effects in the Indian social milieu. Since diversity effects are context-specific, in a first, we test the moderating impact of employee's perceived organisational politics on the inclusion mediated diversity-well-being link among 617 employees from Indian organisations. Post ascertaining the measurement model fit using AMOS 22, we used PROCESS to test for moderated-mediation effects. Perception of organisational politics moderated the surface diversity-inclusion-well-being link such that inclusion was found to be weaker for employees who perceived high politics. We discuss the implications for managers.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0970389622000684

	Trends in racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring in six Western countries	We examine trends in racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring in six European and North American countries: Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States. Our sample includes all available discrimination estimates from 90 field experimental studies of hiring discrimination, encompassing more than 170,000 applications for jobs. The years covered vary by country, ranging from 1969 to 2017 for Great Britain to 1994 to 2017 for Germany. We examine trends in discrimination against four racial-ethnic origin groups: African/Black, Asian, Latin American/Hispanic, and Middle Eastern or North African. The results indicate that levels of discrimination in callbacks have remained either unchanged or slightly increased overall for most countries and origin categories. There are three notable exceptions. First, hiring discrimination against ethnic groups with origins in the Middle East and North Africa increased during the 2000s relative to the 1990s. Second, we find that discrimination in France declined, although from very high to "merely" high levels. Third, we find evidence that discrimination in the Netherlands has increased over time. Controls for study characteristics do not change these trends. Contrary to the idea that discrimination will tend to decline in Western countries, we find that discrimination has not fallen over the last few decades in five of the six Western countries we examine.	https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2212875120

	Why and when female directors are less engaged in their board duties: An interface perspective	Female representation on boards is perhaps one of the most studied topics in board-governance research. At the same time, much is unknown about female directors' task engagement within boards. Drawing from psychological theory on societal gender beliefs, our study tests whether the impact of director gender on supervisory task engagement hinges on status dynamics in two relational interfaces: the director-board interface and the director-CEO interface. According to this perspective, female directors show less task engagement because gender is a diffuse status cue that creates status differentiation within the director-board interface. Multi-source board survey data (n¬†=¬†61 boards, n¬†=¬†315 directors) confirms that, within the confines of the boardroom, female directors do, indeed, receive lower-status ratings than male directors. This effect is weaker when boards have a female chair. Furthermore, lower status explains perceived lower task engagement of female directors, but this link critically hinges on the CEO-director interface. The impact of status differences is more pronounced when directors intersect with a relatively dominant CEO. All in all, the results demonstrate that relational interfaces play a key role for female directors' task engagement in their board duties.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024630121000546

	Don't Just Sponsor Women and People of Color - Defend Them	Having an "overly" analytical and unemotional leadership style is a complaint many female leaders and leaders from marginalized racial groups have levied at them. Others are criticized for being "too emotional." In general, these leaders often suffer from the Goldilocks dilemma: They're either being too much of one thing or not enough of that same thing. When such criticisms are levied, it's critical for female leaders and leaders of color to have people willing to sponsor them by defending them to others. Defending comes with a certain amount of risk, and it's the responsibility of the most powerful sponsors - typically white men - to take on that risk.	https://hbr.org/2023/02/dont-just-sponsor-women-and-people-of-color-defend-them
	Ricki Tarr (@RickiTarr@beige.party)	I am white, and was raised in small mostly white communities when I was young, but moved to a larger city as a young teenager. Like a lot of white kids, I didn't understand how much of a thing casual everyday racism was, until I met my future best friend Cameron. I'd never been pulled over by the cops before, and now suddenly I was getting pulled over frequently, for no reason at all, the only difference was now there was a black man in the car. I remember the first time getting pulled over, and the cop asking for all of our ID's with no explanation at all, Cam saw me about to mouth off, and the look of terror on his face made me shut up immediately. Later, he told me when it happened again to just comply, don't ask questions, don't get angry. I had never had to view cops with fear before, in my mind, you only needed to be afraid if you were a criminal, but Cam was afraid, just for existing as black. If people try to tell you that black people are dramatizing their struggle, they are lying!	https://beige.party/@RickiTarr/109857811337655238

	Digestive system infection by SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2: Entry mechanism, clinical symptoms and expression of major receptors (Review)	Besides causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS‚Äëcoronavirus 2 (SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2) also harms the digestive system. Given the appearance of numerous cases of SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2, it has been demonstrated that SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 is able to harm target organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas, and either worsen the condition of patients with basic digestive illnesses or make their prognosis poor. According to several previously published studies, angiotensin‚Äëconverting enzyme II (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease II (TMPRSS2) are expressed either singly or in combination in the digestive system and in other regions of the human body. In order to change the viral conformation, create a fusion hole and release viral RNA into the host cell for replication and transcription, SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 is capable of binding to these two proteins through the spike protein on its surface. As a result, the body experiences an immune reaction and an inflammatory reaction, which may lead to nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and even gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated levels of liver enzymes, acute liver injury, pancreatitis and other serious lesions. In order to provide possible strategies for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of digestive system diseases during the COVID‚Äë19 pandemic, the molecular structure of SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 and the mechanism via which SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 enters the human body through ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were discussed in the present review, and the clinical manifestations of SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 infection in the digestive system were also summarized. Finally, the expression characteristics of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the main target organs of the digestive system were described.	https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijmm.2023.5222

	Resilience, higher education and widening participation: generating change for care experienced students	Over 80,000 children in England were being looked after in Local Authority care in 2020 and a further 40,000 people were defined as 'care leavers'. Although a significant body of research highlights the prevalence of educational low achievement in the care experienced population, official government figures show that around 13% of care experienced pupils progress to higher education by the age of 19. In a climate of 'widening participation' in which universities encourage inclusion and student diversity, this research invited students with a care background to discuss their experiences of settling into university life. Data was collected using in-depth interviews with 42 students from four universities and an online survey completed by 192 students in 29 universities in England and Wales. Findings revealed that although care experienced students overcome significant challenges to progress to higher education, over half considered dropping out. Others reported feeling isolated and inadequately supported, both financially and pastorally, by their institution. This paper uses a lens of resilience to consider the environmental factors that impact upon student transitions, and concludes that universities must act to balance inequalities in order to appropriately welcome and appreciate care leavers for the skills and experience they bring.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-022-00985-8

	Decolonizing Inclusive Education through Trauma-Informed Theories	Notwithstanding its noble orientations and social justice foundations, inclusion has been contested, interrogated, and subjected to multiple interpretations and enactments. Inclusive education has been, inter alia, characterized as a neo-colonial project that is embroiled in and reinforces geopolitical power asymmetries and oppressive regimes. The article suggests that the enduring legacy of colonial perspectives needs to be problematized and challenged through a trauma-responsive lens that captures the traumatizing effects of colonialism/ty on the 'lived' realities of disabled and other disenfranchised groups of students. Trauma is a constituent element of intersectional oppression stemming from and imbricated in conditions of colonial structures of power that conceal and legitimize social inequalities, extreme poverty, malnutrition, violence, substandard childcare, racism, and other 'cultural' traumas. This is an issue that highlights the imperative of developing theories of inclusion that acknowledge and address the intersections of colonialism/ty, disability and trauma and their impact on educational accessibility, participation, and achievement.	http://www.sjdr.se/articles/10.16993/sjdr.951/

	Hypervisibility and Invisibility: Black Women's Experiences with Gendered Racial Microaggressions on a White Campus	This study focuses on the gendered racial microaggressions that Black undergraduate women experience while attending a historically predominately white university. Expanding from the racial microaggression literature, gendered racial microaggressions demonstrate how race is gendered and how gender is racialized for Black women. Because Black women experience dual oppression, the microaggressions they receive should be examined from an intersectional perspective. My study helps fill in the gaps of literature by taking an intersectional perspective to explore and center Black college women's experiences with gendered racism by examining the gendered racial microaggressions they experience within the classroom and in general areas on campus. This study took a qualitative approach to uncover Black women's experiences with microaggressions at a white university. I interviewed 25 Black undergraduate women who attended a flagship university in the Midwest. Gendered racial microaggressions showed up in themes of hypervisibility within classroom settings and invisibility in general spaces on campus. Within classroom settings, Black undergraduate women's race and gender were seen as hypervisible and were microaggressed by white classmates and white faculty. On the contrary, in general spaces on campus, Black women were ignored or excluded from conversations with white students. Both invisibility and hypervisibility speak of Black women's marginalization. Their experiences demonstrate the ways that both sexist and racist ideas about Black women and their abilities contribute to their marginalization, invalidation, and erasure on campus.	http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23326492221138222

	Hyper/neuroinflammation in COVID-19 and suicide etiopathogenesis: Hypothesis for a nefarious collision?	Accumulating scientific and clinical evidence highlighted pathological hyperinflammation as a cardinal feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute COVID-19 disease. With the emergence of long COVID-19 syndrome, several chronic health consequences, including neuropsychiatric sequelae, have gained attention from the public and medical communities. Since inflammatory mediators have also been accredited as putative biomarkers of suicidal ideations and behaviors, hyper- and neuroinflammation might share some colliding points, overlapping and being interconnected in the context of COVID-19. This review aims to provide a summary of current knowledge on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of COVID-19-associated hyper/neuroinflammation with focus on their relevance to the inflammatory hypothesis of suicide development. Subsequently, strategies to alleviate COVID-19 hyper/neuroinflammation by immunomodulatory agents (many of which at experimental stages) as well as psychopharmacologic/psychotherapeutic approaches are also mentioned. While suicide risk in COVID-19 survivors - until now little known - needs further analysis through longitudinal studies, current observations and mechanistic postulates warrant additional attention to this possibly emerging mental health concern.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763422000951

With fewer than 430 Indigenous academics currently employed here on the conti- nent now commonly referred to as 'Australia', and 69% of that cohort identifying as female, what does it look like to experience this demand as an Indigenous academic woman? Drawing on data collected from a Nation-wide study in 2019 of 17 one- on-one, face-to-face interviews with Indigenous academic women, using Indigenous research methodologies and poetic transcription, this paper explores the experiences and relational aspects of Indigenous academic women's roles in Australian higher education.	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?scp=85089179811&partnerID=8YFLogxK

	The wicked problem of B(A)ME degree award gaps and systemic racism in our universities	The independent regulator for higher education in England, the Office for Students (OfS), set new national targets in late 2018 to achieve equality of opportunity in higher education by tackling degree award gaps. The sector response to this was to measure degree award gaps between B(A)ME students and white students in their higher education institutions. Analysis of degree award gaps using quantitative methods has revealed an "unexplained gap". We argue that the existence of this "unexplained gap" is evidence of "systemic racism". However, the factors influencing a degree award and their associated gaps across different racialized groups of students are so complex, that its problematisation, never-mind its solution is inherently complex. It is our view, therefore, racialized degree award gaps are a wicked problem. Despite this, it is also our view that it is an important social justice endeavor that we must still seek to address as a sector. To do so, we propose a mixed methods approach that uses dynamic centring and an intersectional lens to better understand the experiences of racialized students within the higher education "system". Current quantitative analysis of degree award gaps simply tells us how different groups of racialized students experience the system. In using a mixed methods approach in the way we outline, we may better understand the racialized lived experience of our students and the factors influencing the experience of different racialized groups within the "system". This solution-focused approach can help create opportunities that enable students to better navigate social structures and systems and improve their experience in the system. However, this will not address the wicked problem of degree award gaps itself, which is complex, pervasive, and messy.	https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsoc.2022.971923

	The Surprising Benefits of Work/Life Support	To succeed, almost every employee needs work/life support at some point. Women and people of color need it the most, research shows, because they face greater challenges and have fewer resources available to them. They are also the least likely to receive it, however, and as a result often are forced to change or leave jobs and lose out on opportunities for advancement. Given that situation, the authors decided to examine what effects various corporate work/life programs had on the management workforce. Analyzing data from more than 800 U.S. companies over 30 years, they found that when companies offered flexible work schedules, family leave, and childcare support to all employees, the percentage of women and people of color in management rose significantly. In fact, those work/life benefits had a larger impact than the most popular racial-equity programs did. Companies have long known that programs promoting work/life balance boost productivity, reduce turnover, and improve employees' mental and physical health. And now it's clear that they are also a powerful way to increase organizational diversity.	https://hbr.org/2022/09/the-surprising-benefits-of-work-life-support

	Nobel and Novice: Author Prominence Affects Peer Review	Peer-review is a well-established cornerstone of the scientific process, yet it is not immune to status bias. Merton identified the problem as one in which prominent researchers get disproportionately great credit for their contribution while relatively unknown researchers get disproportionately little credit (Merton, 1968). We measure the extent of this effect in the peer-review process through a pre-registered field experiment. We invite more than 3,300 researchers to review a paper jointly written by a prominent author - a Nobel laureate - and by a relatively unknown author - an early-career research associate -, varying whether reviewers see the prominent author's name, an anonymized version of the paper, or the less well-known author's name. We find strong evidence for the status bias: while only 23 percent recommend "reject" when the prominent researcher is the only author shown, 48 percent do so when the paper is anonymized, and 65 percent do so when the little-known author is the only author shown. Our findings complement and extend earlier results on double-anonymized vs. single-anonymized review (Peters and Ceci, 1982; Blank, 1991; Cox et al., 1993; Okike et al., 2016; Tomkins et al., 2017; Card and Della Vigna, 2020) and strongly suggest that double-anonymization is a minimum requirement for an unbiased review process.	https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4190976

	We can talk the talk, but we're not allowed to walk the walk': the role of equality and diversity staff in higher education institutions in England	This article draws on interviews with 41 equality and diversity staff in higher education institutions in England who were not members of the Race Equality Charter (REC). It uses the concept of Whiteness and White privilege to argue that within the framework of White normative practices, the role of equality and diversity staff are used as a smokescreen to perpetuate a system of White privilege. Higher education institutions who are not members of the REC do not invest in such initiatives to protect their own White interests. Rather, they give the appearance of addressing equalities under the guise of the Equality Act (2010). The article argues that in order for racial inequalities to be addressed, policy making such as the REC must be mandatory. Furthermore, higher education institutions must consider how they empower equality and diversity staff in order that they have the time, resources and commitment from senior managers to instigate real organisational change.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-022-00835-7

	Capitalism and extreme poverty: A global analysis of real wages, human height, and mortality since the long 16th century	This paper assesses claims that, prior to the 19th century, around 90% of the human population lived in extreme poverty (defined as the inability to access essential goods), and that global human welfare only began to improve with the rise of capitalism. These claims rely on national accounts and PPP exchange rates that do not adequately capture changes in people's access to essential goods. We assess this narrative against extant data on three empirical indicators of human welfare: real wages (with respect to a subsistence basket), human height, and mortality. We ask whether these indicators improved or deteriorated with the rise of capitalism in five world regions - Europe, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and China - using the chronology put forward by world-systems theorists. The evidence we review here points to three conclusions. (1) It is unlikely that 90% of the human population lived in extreme poverty prior to the 19th century. Historically, unskilled urban labourers in all regions tended to have wages high enough to support a family of four above the poverty line by working 250¬†days or 12 months a year, except during periods of severe social dislocation, such as famines, wars, and institutionalized dispossession - particularly under colonialism. (2) The rise of capitalism caused a dramatic deterioration of human welfare. In all regions studied here, incorporation into the capitalist world-system was associated with a decline in wages to below subsistence, a deterioration in human stature, and an upturn in premature mortality. In parts of South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, key welfare metrics have still not recovered. (3) Where progress has occurred, significant improvements in human welfare began several centuries after the rise of capitalism. In the core regions of Northwest Europe, progress began in the 1880s, while in the periphery and semi-periphery it began in the mid-20th century, a period characterized by the rise of anti-colonial and socialist political movements that redistributed incomes and established public provisioning systems.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X22002169

	Coniston massacre	The Coniston massacre, which took place in the region around the Coniston cattle station in the then Territory of Central Australia (now the Northern Territory) from 14 August to 18 October 1928, was the last known officially sanctioned massacre of Indigenous Australians and one of the last events of the Australian Frontier Wars.  In a series of punitive expeditions led by Northern Territory Police constable William George Murray, people of the Warlpiri, Anmatyerre, and Kaytetye groups were killed. The massacre occurred in response to the murder of dingo hunter Frederick Brooks, killed by Aboriginal people in August 1928 at a place called Yukurru, also known as Brooks Soak. Official records at the time state that at least 31 people were killed, however analysis of existing documentation and Aboriginal oral histories reveal that the fatalities were likely to have been as high as 200.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coniston_massacre&oldid=1096999023

	Ten simple rules to host an inclusive conference	Conferences are spaces to meet and network within and across academic and technical fields, learn about new advances, and share our work. They can help define career paths and create long-lasting collaborations and opportunities. However, these opportunities are not equal for all. This article introduces 10 simple rules to host an inclusive conference based on the authors' recent experience organizing the 2021 edition of the useR! statistical computing conference, which attracted a broad range of participants from academia, industry, government, and the nonprofit sector. Coming from different backgrounds, career stages, and even continents, we embraced the challenge of organizing a high-quality virtual conference in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and making it a kind, inclusive, and accessible experience for as many people as possible. The rules result from our lessons learned before, during, and after the organization of the conference. They have been written mainly for potential organizers and selection committees of conferences and contain multiple practical tips to help a variety of events become more accessible and inclusive. We see this as a starting point for conversations and efforts towards building more inclusive conferences across the world. * Translated versions of the English abstract and the list of rules are available in 10 languages in S1 Text: Arabic, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, and Thai.	https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010164

	The moral psychology of misinformation: Why we excuse dishonesty in a post-truth world	Commentators say we have entered a "post-truth" era. As political lies and "fake news" flourish, citizens appear not only to believe misinformation, but also to condone misinformation they do not believe. The present article reviews recent research on three psychological factors that encourage people to condone misinformation: partisanship, imagination, and repetition. Each factor relates to a hallmark of "post-truth" society: political polarization, leaders who push "alterative facts," and technology that amplifies disinformation. By lowering moral standards, convincing people that a lie's "gist" is true, or dulling affective reactions, these factors not only reduce moral condemnation of misinformation, but can also amplify partisan disagreement. We discuss implications for reducing the spread of misinformation.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X2200094X

	Women are Credited Less in Science than are Men	There is a well-documented gap in the observed number of scientific works produced by women and men in science, with clear consequences for the retention and promotion of women in science1. The gap might be a result of productivity differences2-5, or it might be due to women's contributions not being acknowledged6,7. This paper finds that at least part of this gap is due to the latter: women in research teams are significantly less likely to be credited with authorship than are men. The findings are consistent across three very different sources of data. Analysis of the first source - large scale administrative data on research teams, team scientific output, and attribution of credit - show that women are significantly less likely to be named on any given article or patent produced by their team relative to their peers. The gender gap in attribution is found across almost all scientific fields and career stages. The second source - an extensive survey of authors - similarly shows that women's scientific contributions are systematically less likely to be recognized. The third source - qualitative responses - suggests that the reason is that their work is often not known, not appreciated, or ignored. At least some of the observed gender gap in scientific output may not be due to differences in scientific contribution, but to differences in attribution.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04966-w

	Nalanda: India's ancient university rising from the ashes	Founded in the 5th Century, India's Nalanda University is believed to be the world's first residential university. Established more than 500 years before Oxford University, at its peak Nalanda hosted over 10,000 students from around the world and was considered one of the greatest centres of learning in the ancient world. The university was destroyed around the end of the 12th Century, its legendary library burnt to the ground and much of its ancient knowledge lost. It wasn't until the 19th Century that the ruins of Nalanda were rediscovered, and now, around 800 years after it was lost, the university is being relaunched for the modern age.

In the novel, Sam Vimes, the captain of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, reasons that poverty causes greater expenses to the poor than to those who are richer. Since its publication, the theory has received wider attention, especially in regard to the effect of increasing prices of daily necessities.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boots_theory&oldid=1090480288

	Trust and accountability in UK charities: Exploring the virtuous circle	Public trust and confidence in charities is essential for the achievement of their missions. However, recent evidence suggests that trust in UK charities has been damaged, potentially affecting charities' and the charity sector's sustainability and effectiveness. This paper constructs accountability as an important means of developing, maintaining and restoring trust in charities. Through a series of interviews with charity managers, it investigates the public and private mechanisms used in discharging accountability to, and building trust with, charities' main stakeholder groups. The paper identifies the use of a wide range of mechanisms, often highly tailored to particular stakeholders' perceived information needs, which are seen as critical in this process. It is argued that the use and interplay of these can create a 'virtuous circle' of accountability and trust, where each reinforces the other. It is argued that where this is achieved, trust in individual charities, and the sector as a whole, can be enhanced.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890838917300549

	White and non-White Australian mental health care practitioners' desirable responding, cultural competence, and racial/ethnic attitudes	Racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity in Australia is rapidly increasing. Although Indigenous Australians account for only approximately 3.5% of the country's population, over 50% of Australians were born overseas or have at least one migrant parent. Migration accounts for over 60% of Australia's population growth, with migration from Asia, Sub-Saharan African and the Americas increasing by 500% in the last decade. Little is known about Australian mental health care practitioners' attitudes toward this diversity and their level of cultural competence.	https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00818-4

	To a Safer Place	This inspiring film is the story of how one woman has come to terms with her life as a survivor of incest. Sexually abused by her father from infancy to early adolescence, Shirley Turcotte is now in her thirties and has succeeded in building a rich and full life. In To a Safer Place, Shirley takes a further step to reconcile her past and present. The film accompanies her as she returns to the people and places of her childhood. Her mother, brothers and sister, all of whom were also caught up in the cycle of family violence, openly share their thoughts. Their frank disclosures will encourage survivors of incest to break through the silence and betrayal to recover and develop a sense of self-worth and dignity.

	Waking up to Marginalization: Public Value Failures in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science	Data science education is increasingly becoming an integral part of many educational structures, both informal and formal. Much of the attention has been on the application of AI principles and techniques, especially machine learning, natural language processing and predictive analytics. While AI is only one phase in the data science ecosystem, we must embrace a fuller range of job roles that help manage AI algorithms and systems - from the AI innovators and architects (in CS, Math and Statistics) to the AI technicians and specialists (in CS, IT and IS). Also, it's important that we better understand the current state of the low participation and representation of minoritized groups that further stifles the accessibility and inclusion efforts. However, how we learn and what we learn is highly dependent on who we are as learners. In this paper, we examine demographic disparities by race/ethnicity and gender within the information systems educational infrastructure from an evaluative perspective. More specifically, we adopt intersectional methods and apply the theory of public value failure to identify learning gaps in the fast-growing field of data science. National datasets of Master's and Doctoral graduate students in IS, CS, Math and Statistics are used to create an "institutional parity score" which calculates field-specific representation by race/ethnicity and gender in data science related fields. We conclude by showcasing bias creep including the situational exclusion of individuals from access to the broader information economy, be it access to technologies and data or access to participate in the data workforce or data enabled-economic activity.

	How the Best Bosses Interrupt Bias on Their Teams	Companies spend millions on antibias training each year in hopes of creating more-inclusive-and thereby innovative and effective-workforces. Studies show that well-managed diverse groups perform better and are more committed, have higher collective intelligence, and excel at making decisions and solving problems. But research also shows that bias-prevention programs rarely deliver. So what can you, as an individual leader, do to ensure that your team is including and making the most of diverse voices? How can one person fix what an entire organization can't? Although bias itself is devilishly hard to change, it is not as difficult to interrupt. The authors have identified several practices that managers can use to counter bias (and avoid its negative effects) without spending a lot of time or political capital. In hiring, leaders should insist on a diverse pool, precommit to objective criteria, limit referral hiring, and structure interviews around skills-based questions. Day to day, they should ensure that high- and low-value work is assigned evenly and run meetings in a way that guarantees all voices are heard. In evaluating and developing people, they should clarify criteria for positive reviews and promotions, stick to those rules, and separate potential from performance and personality from skill sets.	https://hbr.org/2019/11/how-the-best-bosses-interrupt-bias-on-their-teams

	Identifying and dismantling racism in Australian perinatal settings: Reframing the narrative from a risk lens to intentionally prioritise connectedness and strengths in providing care to First Nations families	Introduction  The perinatal period is a time when provision of responsive care offers a life course opportunity for positive change to improve health outcomes for mothers, infants and families. Australian perinatal systems carry the legacy of settler-colonialism, manifesting in racist events and interactions that First Nations parents encounter daily.  Objective  The dominance of a western risk lens, and conscious and unconscious bias in the child protection workforce, sustains disproportionately high numbers of First Nations infants being removed from their parents' care. Cascading medical interventions compound existing stressors and magnify health inequities for First Nations women.  Design  Critical discourse was informed by Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing via targeted dialogue with a group of First Nations and non-Indigenous experts in Australian perinatal care who are co-authors on this paper. Dynamic discussion evolved from a series of yarning circles, supplemented by written exchanges and individual yarns as themes were consolidated.  Results  First Nations maternity services prioritise self-determination, partnership, strengths and communication and have demonstrated positive outcomes with, and high satisfaction from First Nations women. Mainstream perinatal settings could be significantly enhanced by embracing similar principles and models of care.  Conclusions and relevance  The Australian Anti-racism in Perinatal Practice (AAPP) Alliance calls for urgent transformations to Australian perinatal models of care whereby non-Indigenous health policy makers, managers and clinicians take a proactive role in identifying and redressing ethnocentrism, judgemental and culturally blind practices, reframing the risk narrative, embedding strength-based approaches and intentionally prioritising engagement and connectedness within service delivery.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871519222000749

	The Diversity-Innovation Paradox in Science	Significance    By analyzing data from nearly all US PhD recipients and their dissertations across three decades, this paper finds demographically underrepresented students innovate at higher rates than majority students, but their novel contributions are discounted and less likely to earn them academic positions. The discounting of minorities' innovations may partly explain their underrepresentation in influential positions of academia.    ,    Prior work finds a diversity paradox: Diversity breeds innovation, yet underrepresented groups that diversify organizations have less successful careers within them. Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well? We study this by utilizing a near-complete population of ‚àº1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977 to 2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity's role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.	https://pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1915378117

	Ethical Machine Learning in Healthcare	The use of machine learning (ML) in healthcare raises numerous ethical concerns, especially as models can amplify existing health inequities. Here, we outline ethical considerations for equitable ML in the advancement of healthcare. Specifically, we frame ethics of ML in healthcare through the lens of social justice. We describe ongoing efforts and outline challenges in a proposed pipeline of ethical ML in health, ranging from problem selection to postdeployment considerations. We close by summarizing recommendations to address these challenges.

	As Masks Come Off, Immunocompromised Americans Feel Left Behind	The latest CDC guidance puts nearly 70% of the U.S. population in low or medium risk areas, and residents are no longer expected to wear a mask. In response, the vast majority of states in the U.S. have lifted or plan to lift mask mandates.    While many Americans welcome the loosening of pandemic-era safety rules, people who are higher risk feel forgotten and left behind. Johnnie Jae is an Indigenous journalist and public speaker; Charis Hill is a disability activist; and Cass Condray is a university student.

	A framework for operationalising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander data sovereignty in Australia: Results of a systematic literature review of published studies	Background  Racial health disparities are only likely to be meaningfully improved by tailoring public health and clinical interventions to the specific needs of Indigenous people and their communities. Accurate tailoring relies on the availability of high-quality Indigenous-specific data. The potential benefits of increased availability of Indigenous data need to be balanced by efforts to ensure those data are collected and used appropriately. This paper identifies characteristics of Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) principles and considers a framework for operationalisation.  Methods  A PRISMA compliant search of the literature was undertaken, using methods detailed in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook on Systematic Reviews of Health Promotion and Public Health Interventions (1). The search strategy comprised two steps: a search of 11 scientific electronic databases and five grey literature sources. The search was limited by date of publication (1 January 2000 to 1 December 2021). The following keywords and subject heading terms were used: (exp Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander or Aborigin* or Torres Strait Island* or, Oceanic ancestry group) and (exp research or biomedical research or population surveillance or translational medical research or, research design) and (exp data or datasets or data collection or data management or health surveys or information dissemination or, intellectual property) and (exp self-determination or ownership or control or access or possession or OCAP or sovereignty or, ethics) and, (exp Australia). IDS principles: (i) ownership; (ii) control; (iii) accessibility; (iv) custodianship; (v) accountability to Indigenous people; (vi) amplify Community voice; (vii) relevant and reciprocal; and (viii) sustainably self-determining. Using standard data extraction forms, we examined relevant Australian studies to identify key characteristics and frequency with which they cited IDS principles. These findings were consolidated into an operationalisation framework.  Findings  34 relevant Australian published studies were identified. The most frequently cited IDS principles were Accountability to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and sustainably self-determining. The least frequently cited principle was Access. A framework to operationalise IDS principles is proposed that is both standardised internationally and able to be tailored to the diverse contexts of Indigenous peoples.  Interpretation  IDS is emergent in Australia and there is a clear need to establish an agreed set of International IDS principles and a framework for their operationalisation and contextualisation across diverse Indigenous communities and contexts.  Funding  This research project is funded through an Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Grant from 2017 to 2022. The National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC) is funded by the Australian Government Department of Health.

	Snapshot		https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot
	Business Plot	The Business Plot (also called the Wall Street Putsch and The White House Putsch) was an alleged political conspiracy in 1933 in the United States to overthrow the government of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and install a dictator. Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler asserted that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a fascist veterans' organization with Butler as its leader and use it in a coup d'√©tat to overthrow Roosevelt. In 1934, Butler testified under oath before the United States House of Representatives Special Committee on Un-American Activities (the "McCormack-Dickstein Committee") on these revelations. Although no one was prosecuted, the congressional committee final report said, "there is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient."  Early in the committee's gathering of testimony most major news media dismissed the plot, with a New York Times editorial characterizing it as a "gigantic hoax". While historians have questioned whether or not a coup was actually close to execution, most agree that some sort of "wild scheme" was contemplated and discussed.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_Plot&oldid=1073459185

	<i>Lancet</i> surveys of Iraq War casualties	The Lancet, one of the oldest scientific medical journals in the world, published two peer-reviewed studies on the effect of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation on the Iraqi mortality rate. The first was published in 2004; the second (by many of the same authors) in 2006. The studies estimate the number of excess deaths caused by the occupation, both direct (combatants plus non-combatants) and indirect (due to increased lawlessness, degraded infrastructure, poor healthcare, etc.).  The first survey published on 29 October 2004, estimated 98,000 excess Iraqi deaths (with a range of 8,000 to 194,000, using a 95% confidence interval (CI)) from the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq to that time, or about 50% higher than the death rate prior to the invasion. The authors described this as a conservative estimate, because it excluded the extreme statistical outlier data from Fallujah. If the Fallujah cluster were included, the mortality estimate would increase to 150% over pre-invasion rates (95% CI: 1.6 to 4.2).  The second survey published on 11 October 2006, estimated 654,965 excess deaths related to the war, or 2.5% of the population, through the end of June 2006. The new study applied similar methods and involved surveys between 20 May and 10 July 2006. More households were surveyed, allowing for a 95% confidence interval of 392,979 to 942,636 excess Iraqi deaths. 601,027 deaths (range of 426,369 to 793,663 using a 95% confidence interval) were due to violence. 31% (186,318) of those were attributed to the US-led Coalition, 24% (144,246) to others, and 46% (276,472) unknown. The causes of violent deaths were gunshot (56% or 336,575), car bomb (13% or 78,133), other explosion/ordnance (14%), air strike (13% or 78,133), accident (2% or 12,020), and unknown (2%).  The mortality estimates in the Lancet surveys are higher than in several other reports, including those of the Iraqi Health Ministry and the United Nations, as well as other household surveys such as the Iraq Living Conditions Survey and the Iraq Family Health Survey. The 2007 ORB survey of Iraq War casualties estimated more deaths than the Lancet, though it covered a longer period of the conflict. The Lancet surveys have triggered criticism and disbelief from some journalists, governments, the Iraq Body Count project, some epidemiologists and statisticians and others, but have also been supported by some journalists, governments, epidemiologists and statisticians.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lancet_surveys_of_Iraq_War_casualties&oldid=1060035786

	Cosmopolitan Brands: graduate students navigating the social space of elite global universities	Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's analysis of the competition for economic, social and cultural capitals within educational fields, this article reports empirical research from 49 in-depth interviews with graduate students at four elite universities in the USA and the UK. It argues the brands of elite global universities work to reproduce social and cultural capital for a small cohort of elite students, and by doing so perpetuate and reinforce systems that privilege a select few. By drawing upon student narratives, our findings demonstrate the cosmopolitan nature of elite university brands. These 'Cosmopolitan Brands' are immersed in local and highly exclusive practices which reinforce wider inequalities of social class. We explore how individual students navigate their immersion and positioning within the brands of global elite universities; competing first as students at university before progressing to compete for power and status within global economies.	https://doi.org/10.1080/01425692.2021.1941763

	How narratives of racial progress create barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations	Despite statements in support of racial justice, many organizations fail to make good on their commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In this review, we describe the role of the narrative of racial progress-which conceives of society as rapidly and automatically ascending toward racial equity-in these failures. Specifically, the narrative¬†(1) envisions organizations as race neutral, (2) creates barriers to complex cross-race discussions about equity, (3) creates momentum for less effective policy change, and (4) reduces urgency around DEI goals. Thus, an effective DEI strategy will involve organizational leaders overcoming this narrative by acknowledging past DEI failures¬†and, most critically, implementing immediate and evidence-based structural changes that are essential for creating a more just and equitable workplace.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21000944

	The Mutually Reinforcing Cycle Of Poor Data Quality And Racialized Stereotypes That Shapes Asian American Health	The Asian American health narrative reflects a long history of structural racism in the US and the complex interplay of racialized history, immigrant patterns, and policies regarding Asians in the US. Yet owing to systematic issues in data collection including missing or misclassified data for Asian Americans and practices that lead to indiscriminate grouping of unlike individuals (for example, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Bangladeshi) together in data systems and pervasive stereotypes of Asian Americans, the drivers and experiences of health disparities experienced by these diverse groups remain unclear. The perpetual exclusion and misrepresentation of Asian American experiences in health research is exacerbated by three racialized stereotypes-the model minority, healthy immigrant effect, and perpetual foreigner-that fuel scientific and societal perceptions that Asian Americans do not experience health disparities. This codifies racist biases against the Asian American population in a mutually reinforcing cycle. In this article we describe the poor-quality data infrastructure and biases on the part of researchers and public health professionals, and we highlight examples from the health disparities literature. We provide recommendations on how to implement systems-level change and educational reform to infuse racial equity in future policy and practice for Asian American communities.	https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01417

	White Coats, White Hoods: The Medical Politics of the Ku Klux Klan in 1920s America	, summary:, This article explores the medical politics of the second iteration of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States. As eugenics gained a foothold in America at the turn of the twentieth century, the Klan embraced the latest in scientific racism to lend legitimacy to their cultural, political, and economic goals of white supremacy. Klan physicians in particular held a vested interest in preserving a racialized medical hierarchy and promoting reproductive surveillance in public health. By the 1920s, a symbiotic relationship developed between the organization and the medical profession. The Klan relied on its member physicians to lend professional respectability to the organization and scientific legitimacy to its agenda. In turn, affiliation with the Klan gave physicians an opportunity for career advancement and provided the muscle to intimidate professional and political opponents.	https://muse.jhu.edu/article/846640

	Conference demographics and footprint changed by virtual platforms	Conferences disseminate research, grow professional networks and train employees. Unfortunately, they also contribute to climate change and present barriers to achieving a socially sustainable work environment. Here, we analyse the recent impact of transforming in-person conferences into virtual conferences on improving diversity, equity and inclusion in science and engineering conferences. Factors including cost, gender, career stage and geographic location were evaluated. Virtual conferences demonstrated a clearly discernable and, in some cases, orders of magnitude improvement across nearly all metrics. On the basis of participant survey results, this improvement may be attributed to a combination of reduced financial and personal-life burdens. However, despite this clear impact, further development of virtual networking features and poster sessions is necessary to achieve widespread adoption and acceptance of this new format.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00823-2

We find that, in these states, 2.4 million workers lose $8 billion annually (an average of $3,300 per year for year-round workers) to minimum wage violations-nearly a quarter of their earned wages. This form of wage theft affects 17 percent of low-wage workers, with workers in all demographic categories being cheated out of pay.	https://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year/

	Academics of colour in elite universities in the UK and the USA: the 'unspoken system of exclusion'	This article explores the experiences of academics of colour in elite universities in the UK and the USA. Drawing on interviews with 34 respondents and using a critical race theory perspective, the findings indicate that academics of colour experience racism in the White space of an elite university. To counter the racism they experience, they develop 'safe spaces' in which they find empathy and support from other academics of colour. A key finding from the study suggests that despite having negative experiences in elite universities, academics of colour have contradictory feelings about their positions. They disassociate themselves from the racism by recognising the status and prestige associated with working at an elite university. This article suggests that in order for academics of colour to be fully included in elite universities, institutions must acknowledge racism and their own Whiteness to work towards cultural change.	https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2021.2020746

	Confidence, practices and training needs of people working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander LGBTIQ+ clients	Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander LGBTIQ+ peoples face an elevated risk for poor health and social-emotional wellbeing, suggesting that this patient group are likely to attend health and community services. However, the current practices of those who deliver care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander LGBTIQ+ peoples are unknown. Utilising mixed methods (survey; n = 197; focus groups and interviews; n = 56), we explored the current practices, confidence, knowledge, and training needs for working with Aboriginal LGBTIQ+ clients among Western Australian health and community service workers. Participants were predominately from the mental health and social-emotional wellbeing care sector. One-third of survey participants indicated that it was likely Aboriginal LGBTIQ+ peoples accessed their service. On average, participants reported high confidence and knowledge in working with Aboriginal LGBTIQ+ clients. Qualitative data indicated that staff struggled to accommodate what they understood to be the needs of clients who were both Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and LGBTIQ+, despite a willingness to 'get it right'. Findings provide the first-ever snapshot of inclusive practices among health and social support workers in Western Australia.	https://doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2022.2031298

	Why is it so hard to escape poverty? - Ann-Hel√©n Bay	Explore the paradox of welfare programs, and learn how they inadvertently reinforce generational poverty, and what we can do to fix them.    --    Imagine that you've been unemployed for months. Government benefit programs have helped you cover your expenses, but you're barely getting by. Finally, you receive a paycheck- but there's a catch. Your new job pays enough to disqualify you from benefit programs, but not enough to cover your costs. So how do we design benefit programs that don't penalize you for working? Ann-Hel√©n Bay investigates.    Lesson by Ann-Hel√©n Bay, directed by Avi Ofer.

	Do You See What I See? Perceptions of Gender Microaggressions in the Workplace	Although blatant expressions of sexism in the American workforce appear on the decline, many researchers note that discrimination is not disappearing but is instead becoming more subtle and ambiguous. Drawing from Sue et al.'s construct of microaggressions, which examines manifestations of prejudice ranging from subtle to overt, the present research provides the first known empirical investigation of gender differences in third-party perceptions of microaggressions against women at work. Undergraduate women and men read vignettes describing interactions between male supervisors and female subordinates, which portrayed potentially discriminatory supervisor behavior, ranging in explicitness from subtle to blatant. Results indicate that although both men and women perceive differences in microaggression explicitness, women tend to detect greater discrimination than men, particularly when instances are subtle in nature. Both genders expect microaggressions to generate more negative work outcomes as explicitness increases. We discuss practical implications of our research, including the importance of raising awareness of workplace gender microaggressions, especially its most subtle forms, and of developing supporting programs to help observers of discrimination, who may be more likely to be women in cases of perceived microaggressions against women. Future research directions for addressing the broad range of discrimination facing working women today are also explored.	http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0361684313511420
	Advancing Equality in Higher Education: an exploratory study of the Athena SWAN and Race Equality Charters	This one year project will explore aspects of good practice in institutions that have succeeded in securing accreditation at the first level (Bronze).	https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/crre/research/advancing-equality-in-higher-education.aspx
	Competing inequalities: gender versus race in higher education institutions in the UK	This article explores findings from two projects that explore the impacts and institutional experiences of the Athena SWAN (ASC) and Race Equality (REC) Charter Marks in UK universities. The article offers an important, timely and original insight into the ways that these two charter marks are shaping and influencing practice in universities. We argue that in higher education policymaking, there has been a privileging of gender over race in terms of addressing inequalities in higher education. Whilst acknowledging the persistence of inequalities in both groups, the data from our projects highlight a significant risk that gender and race inequalities become conflated in current equalities work. We argue that as a consequence of a logic of efficiency that drives Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to combine gender and race equalities work, and the privileging within this combination of gender, HEIs can publicly work towards equality and inclusion in general terms, without having to confront uncomfortable and deeply embedded practices that perpetuate White privilege in the academy.	https://doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2019.1642305
	Confronting White privilege: the importance of intersectionality in the sociology of education	This article explores how White privilege and a hierarchy of oppression have resulted in competing identities in which gender has been given greater importance compared to race. I argue that the sociology of education needs to adopt an intersectional approach that travels in different directions if it is to remain valid. The article examines how gender, perpetuated by White privilege, continues to play a key role in the positioning of Black and minority ethnic staff, students and pupils within a range of stereotypes that operate to marginalise their life trajectories. The article argues that if sociologists of education are unwilling to challenge White privileged populist discourses and their own positions of White privilege, then they will become complicit in maintaining a socially unjust status quo.	https://doi.org/10.1080/01425692.2020.1755224

	The relationship of race and gender to managers' ratings of promotion potential	The purpose of this paper was to examine the relationship of race and gender to managers' ratings of promotion potential for a sample of 1268 managerial and professional employees. Hierarchial regression analysis showed that controlling for age, education, tenure, salary grade, functional area, and satisfaction with career support, both race and gender were significantly related to promotion potential. Females were rated lower than males, and Blacks and Asians were rated lower than Whites. There were no interaction effects between race and gender.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/job.4030160409

	Promotion decisions as a diversity practice	Proposes that the promotion decision-making process contributes to the differential advancement of women and men in organizations. Compares the actual promotions of 13 women and 16 men at a company known for its diversity practices. Finds that bosses are more hesitant to promote women and require them to demonstrate personal strength and to prove themselves extensively before they get a promotion. Men are less likely to have promotions accounted for in terms of familiarity with job responsibilities and are more likely to have a high level of comfort with the boss as a reason for promotion. Strategies for addressing these differential dynamics include assessments of current promotion practices, modifications to human resource systems to increase accountability for the advancement of women, and coaching for decision makers and sponsors of high-potential women.	https://doi.org/10.1108/02621719510078867

	Reflections on the labyrinth: Investigating black and minority ethnic leaders' career experiences	Black and minority ethnic (BME) employees appear to experience more difficulty reaching senior leadership positions than do their white counterparts. Using Eagly and Carli's metaphor of the labyrinth, our aim was to give voice to black and minority ethnic managers who have successfully achieved senior management roles, and compare their leadership journeys with those of matched white managers. This article used semi-structured interviews and attribution theory to examine how 20 black and minority ethnic and 20 white senior managers from a UK government department made sense of significant career incidents in their leadership journeys. Template analysis was used to identify facilitators and barriers of career progression from causal explanations of these incidents. Although BME and white managers identified four common themes (visibility, networks, development and line manager support), they differed in how they made sense of formal and informal organizational processes to achieve career progression. The findings are used to theorize about the individual and organizational factors that contribute to the leadership journeys of minority ethnic employees.	https://doi.org/10.1177/0018726714550890

	Why People "Don't Trust the Evidence": Motivated Reasoning and Scientific Beliefs	In this commentary, we embed the volume's contributions on public beliefs about science in a broader theoretical discussion of motivated political reasoning. The studies presented in the preceding section of the volume consistently find evidence for hyperskepticism toward scientific evidence among ideologues, no matter the domain or context-and this skepticism seems to be stronger among conservatives than liberals. Here, we show that these patterns can be understood as part of a general tendency among individuals to defend their prior attitudes and actively challenge attitudinally incongruent arguments, a tendency that appears to be evident among liberals and conservatives alike. We integrate the empirical results reported in this volume into a broader theoretical discussion of the John Q. Public model of information processing and motivated reasoning, which posits that both affective and cognitive reactions to events are triggered unconsciously. We find that the work in this volume is largely consistent with our theories of affect-driven motivated reasoning and biased attitude formation.	http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002716214554758
