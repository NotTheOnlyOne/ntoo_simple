	studentactivism	Lewis had written that "For the first time in one hundred years this nation is being awakened to the fact that segregation is evil and that it must be destroyed in all forms. Your presence today proves that you have been aroused to the point of action."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284488468115193856
	studentactivism	Next, Lewis went on to condemn the bill for not including voting rights protections. "As it stands now," his elders added, but that wouldn't be changed before the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964. Voting would have to wait for the Voting Rights Act the following year.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284487271576752128
	studentactivism	"Of," on the other hand, is both tempered and ambiguous‚Äîthe fear of a police state is a fear of something external, and maybe even hypothetical. A tiny change, but one that carries incredible weight.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284486556351430656
	studentactivism	Of all the changes Lewis had foisted on him that day, that one is maybe the most fascinating to me. "In a police state" is an emphatic statement about lived conditions, explicitly naming what it meant, what it was, to be Black in the Jim Crow South.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284486088799780864
	studentactivism	Lewis' elders had him change "the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear in a police state" to "...must live in constant fear OF a police state."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284484917242601472
	studentactivism	Danville had been the site of ongoing civil rights demonstrations and boycotts that spring and summer, and the city government had reacted brutally‚Äîbeating protesters, many of them high school students, using fire hoses on them, cramming them into overcrowded jails.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284484686845284353
	studentactivism	Next, Lewis had written that the Kennedy civil rights bill ("in its present form" in the final version) would not "protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear in a police state."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284484585775079425
	studentactivism	And right after that, a line referring to the bill's failure to "protect young children and old women from police dogs and fire hoses" had the words "in the South" added to it.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284480377025961984
	studentactivism	Why didn't Lewis support the civil rights act "wholeheartedly"? Well, this line, appearing immediately after the one above, gives an indication: "There‚Äôs not one thing in the bill that will protect our people from police brutality." That line was struck entirely.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284479954474991618
	studentactivism	The first problem came in the speech's second sentence, where Lewis said the movement couldn't fully support JFK's civil rights bill, because it was "too little, too late." That got changed to "we support it with great reservation."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284479340202332160
	studentactivism	In the end, the group negotiated more than a dozen significant changes to the speech, each of which moderated its tone and substance and many of which have particular resonance today. The final typed version was completed just moments before Lewis took the stage.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284477363288510464
	studentactivism	John Lewis was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington‚Äîwhere MLK gave the "I have a dream" speech‚Äîand the speech Lewis wrote that day was so incendiary that the march organizers wouldn't let him deliver it as written.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284472208006545408

	OtherSociology	Police issue more fines to poor people than other groups, especially targeting Aboriginal people. Infringement notices for COVID-19 have targeted minorities. Let's talk about Victorian Premier, Daniel Andrews', press conference today, which focused on policing.  THREAD	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280745587399258112
	OtherSociology	Contact tracing is very challenging. Reconciliation of cases is common. Even one COVID-19 case is potentially lethal &amp; highly contagious. However lack of clarity about reconciliation feeds the into the racism that resulted in the residents of the 9 towers being mistreated	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280747508562444289
	OtherSociology	During today's press conference, the Premier was asked whether data on infringement notices would be published in a timely way. The response was vague: "We‚Äôll work though how to share that data"  Troubling, given that the detention of 9 towers residents is a racialised response	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280751284409102337
	OtherSociology	In Wave 1 of COVID-19, Victoria Police issued over 6,000 fines &amp; questioned 50,000 people, esp Aboriginal people &amp; other minorities. They enforced restrictions "inconsistently &amp; arbitrarily." https://t.co/Zk51LUnrp8  Stricter fines will be used to enforce Wave 2 lockdown measures	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280750554570846209
	OtherSociology	The Police Commissioner says police will have "less discretion" on fines. This was a curious position, given it's established that racism impacts infringement notices. Travel permits are not required, however, "Bona fide documents going to work" would help...	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280755063485607937
	OtherSociology	Police's public reporting on race data remains negligible. Using fines to enforce lockdown is ripe for racism  During the press conference, Police Commissioner &amp; Premier discussed a "Rolling series of check points" Reporting on race, fines &amp; location will be vital to monitor bias	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280754251841454081

	OtherSociology	Puzzling logic behind face to face teaching for VCE students.

Except COVID-19 infection rates of older students is relatively high	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280763336850731008
	OtherSociology	The Premier mentioned again, as he did yesterday, that detention of the 9 towers was done on advice of the Chief Health Officer. He emphasised there was no alternative. This seems to be an appeal to authority, rather than deflecting responsibility. Interesting discoursive tact	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280762287381340161
	OtherSociology	On mismanagement of meals for residents of the 9 towers, the Premier said: "There‚Äôs been significant community engagement.

Residents report being denied baby formula, told to wait for medicine &amp; other essentials	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280761506238324737
	OtherSociology	All of this is cause for concern about the lack of transparency about race data and policing during COVID-19 restrictions  The Premier was once again asked if he took responsibility for mismanaging quarantine and uneven approach to lockdown.

	KGuilaine	But let me break this down a bit more, for some of y‚Äôall when it comes to the mental health of Black &amp; Brown groups, there ARE serious gaps, full stop. All so called ‚Äòevidence based‚Äô models are primarily tested on young white folks, disproportionately students.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277324689627582465
	KGuilaine	1) Be very very cautious of those who claim there is little by way of *evidence*, that my friend is RACISM. Black scholars in particular have been writing about racial trauma for over 100 years, detailing the struggles &amp; resistance...the arrogance of discounting such knowledge!	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277319722594439176
	drcbond	Silence for me, has always proved far more violent than speaking. I speak not because I‚Äôm a trouble-maker, I speak because I refuse to accept the role of victim and all that comes with it. https://t.co/Gc8QghEl55	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277195548412407808
	KGuilaine	And that is why white deference is still a thing within community of colour. Do you think you can kill, mutilate, torture, lynch a group people for speaking FOR CENTURIES and think that fear if not terror of speaking will leave no trace?	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277196512393658368
	KGuilaine	I hear this. There structural consequences for those who speak, essentially as @thetwerkinggirl wrote so powerfully, financial &amp; economic abuse is the core weapon of white supremacy. Your silence is often traded for your ability to feed yourself and your family, for way too many.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1277194415178747905

	KGuilaine	One thing we need to discuss is trauma lies at the core of assimilation politics.   And silence is the cost of assimilation.
