I have lost count of the number of time I’ve been told how “stretch opportunities” (such as acting up, secondments, and involvement in significant projects) which are the key to career progression have been filled by a tap on the shoulder followed by promotion. #SideBySide	https://mdxminds.com/2021/09/16/no-more-tick-boxes/

GNOME has reduced accessibility support for screen readers Many GNOME apps have switched from the GTK3 graphics toolkit to GTK4. Sadly, this has made many apps much less usable with screen readers such as orca. If you depend on a screen reader you should consider switching to a different desktop such as Mate, which has better accessibility support. You can do this by installing the mate-desktop-environment package.

This came from years of their own experiences. They got into Linux much more than me, and even compiled their own kernel. Well, this looks like a member of the Gnome Foundation's response to their thread. No, I'm not going to link the blind person here because they don't need anymore bullshit from fossbros. I mean, calling their heart-felt posts a "trauma dump", and that they're "making up shit on the spot", isn't it time that we've had enough of these ableist people? Developers who are indifferent to people with disabilities will definitely see this, and the Gnome folks probably see this kind of talk all the time, that "we can't do this," or "We don't have the time or money," and that kind of talk makes itself true. Accessibility will not move forward with this kind of mentality at the head of one of the most popular Linux desktops. Can we get a little solidarity here? This Gnome foundation person is attacking a blind, nonbinary, Gendervoid person, and I'm sick of this shit going unnoticed. I want you Linux users to think about this. Think about the people who sit there in power. It doesn't take all kinds of people to make a community. Some people aren't just "a little rough around the edges." We need a community of empathetic people that do not punch down.	https://tweesecake.social/@devinprater/110520083513266265

"When staff respond to these incidents, this often leads to more and longer lockdowns.

This is why we are going to ask our panelists and our audience to answer one or both of the following questions: 1. How did someone center and advocate for intersectionality marginalised voices, and how did that make a positive impact? 2.

6/12/2023 21:47:53	Tower lockdown breached human rights, Ombudsman finds	he timing of the lockdown of North Melbourne and Flemington public housing towers on July 4 was not based on direct health advice and violated Victorian human rights laws, an investigation by the Victorian Ombudsman has found.   Ombudsman Deborah Glass said her investigation found that senior health officials agreed on the morning of Saturday, July 4 that the towers should be locked down to control a COVID-19 outbreak, anticipating a next-day start to allow planning for food supplies and other logistics. But at a media conference at 4pm the Premier announced the lockdown, starting immediately.  Ms Glass said the investigation found the immediate start appeared traceable to a Crisis Council of Cabinet meeting at 1.45pm that afternoon. The Ombudsman’s request for documents from the Cabinet meeting, which are subject to privilege, was denied.  She has recommended the Victorian Government apologise to the tower residents, acknowledging the impact of their immediate detention on their health and wellbeing.  "Many residents knew nothing of the lockdown or the reason for it when large numbers of police appeared on their estate that afternoon," Ms Glass said.  "We heard that initially there was chaos. Some people were without food and medicines. At the tower at 33 Alfred St, the focus of the investigation, residents waited more than a week to be allowed outside under supervision for fresh air.”  "Since March, restrictions on movement both broad and specific have been issued many times in Victoria, but never before or since without warning," Ms Glass said.  Ms Glass said the lockdown was lifted at eight of the nine towers after five days, but residents at 33 Alfred St, where infection rates were highest, were detained for another nine days.  The investigation found a temporary lockdown was warranted and successfully contained the outbreak, but that its immediacy was not based on direct public health advice.  "The rushed lockdown was not compatible with the residents' human rights, including their right to humane treatment when deprived of liberty. In my opinion, based on the evidence gathered by the investigation, the action appeared to be contrary to the law."	https://www.ombudsman.vic.gov.au/our-impact/news/public-housing-tower-lockdown/

The Victorian government has settled a class action over measures intended to stop an outbreak of the virus in nine towers at the height of the second wave.  About 3000 residents lived in the Flemington and North Melbourne towers at the time of the lockdown, which led to police surrounding buildings and temporary fences being set up.  The plaintiffs claim people were wrongly detained for up to 14 days and threatened with physical harm if they tried to leave the towers, though the state of Victoria denied those claims.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/09/melbourne-public-housing-tower-residents-win-5m-payout-over-covid-lockdown

6/13/2023 14:32:43	The hidden history of screen readers - For decades, blind programmers have been creating the tools their community needs	It wasn’t until his first job when Henter got what he calls a “talking computer.” This ancestral screen reader, created by Deane Blazie, could only read one character at a time. (For example, the word “PRINT” would be pronounced not as one syllable but as “P-R-I-N-T.”)  Nonetheless, this was a game changer. Henter could perform his job without any assistance. When the next version — one that could read a word at a time — came out, Henter regularly called the company for tech support and became the most known user. Blazie, the head of the company — who would go down in history as one of the few sighted pioneers of the assistive technology industry — soon offered him a job. 	https://www.theverge.com/23203911/screen-readers-history-blind-henter-curran-teh-nvda

The Texas Rangers investigated the shooting, which led to Guyger's arrest three days later.[18]	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Botham_Jean

It is sad to read that students are resigned to the likelihood that nothing will be done if they report a racial incident, so they don’t bother. Instead, they internalise the humiliation and prepare for a career where discrimination is commonplace, no doubt affecting their self esteem and their ability to perform. Action needed to close the attainment gap is in the gift of the GMC. To move things forward, the BMA has launched a charter for medical schools and guidance for students “to prevent and effectively deal with racial harassment.”	https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m568

6/16/2023 7:08:19	Death by racism - The Lancet Infectious Diseases	Due to a reckless and uncoordinated federal response, the USA remains the global epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic with over 3 million confirmed cases and 135 205 confirmed deaths. Black people and other marginalised racial groups are shouldering a disproportionate burden in the current pandemic. Blacks comprise 13% of the US population but roughly one quarter of COVID-19 deaths and are nearly four times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to whites (94·2 vs 24·8 deaths per 100 000). Blacks across all age groups are nearly three times more likely than white people to contract COVID-19. These numbers, while striking, are not surprising and mirror well-documented patterns of morbidity and mortality across a wide range of health outcomes that have been observed in the USA for decades. Experts contend that “racism and not race” is the primary driver of these inequities with many citing “interlocking systems of racism” that have converged to increase exposure, transmission, and death among Blacks. These systems—from healthcare, to housing, to the carceral state—are all rooted in an ideology of white supremacy and the institution of slavery that dates back over 400 years and are maintained by racist policies and practices that construct and reinforce inequitable access to power and resources.	https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30567-3/fulltext

Last year mental health consultant Simon Katterl, who has lived experience, was contracted by the Department of Health to provide advice to the mental health minister about the impact of compulsory mental health treatments on patients.

The Nobel Prize and Fields Medal experience	I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops  (Stephen Jay Gould, 1980)  Opportunities in science largely affect the accumulation of scientific knowledge and, therefore, technological change. However, there is little evidence of how much of people’s talent is actually wasted. Here we focus on scientists with the highest performance, the recipients of the Nobel Prize and Fields Medal. We found that the average age of scientists at the time of the breakthrough was higher for researchers from less developed countries. Moreover, individual opportunities in the world were extremely unequal by country of birth, gender significantly conditioned any participation in research, and the probability of becoming a top researcher more than doubled for individuals with parents belonging to the most favoured occupational categories. 	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04236-y

Then he’d criticise me in front of my colleagues and accuse me of not following instructions, even though I had.”    Diane says, at some point, her manager started making fun of her in front of her team members for everything from what she ate for lunch, to the occasional typo in an email. Today, Diane still works for the same boss. Even though she says things have improved slightly – which she attributes to the team adding heads – she says she still feels “harassed”.	https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230615-why-its-getting-harder-for-some-women-to-report-harassment

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed to differentiate between AI and human-generated content, the fairness and robustness of these detectors remain underexplored. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several widely-used GPT detectors using writing samples from native and non-native English writers. Our findings reveal that these detectors consistently misclassify non-native English writing samples as AI-generated, whereas native writing samples are accurately identified. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple prompting strategies can not only mitigate this bias but also effectively bypass GPT detectors, suggesting that GPT detectors may unintentionally penalize writers with constrained linguistic expressions. Our results call for a broader conversation about the ethical implications of deploying ChatGPT content detectors and caution against their use in evaluative or educational settings, particularly when they may inadvertently penalize or exclude non-native English speakers from the global discourse.	https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819

But last month, the Government reduced the size of the fortnightly supplement from $550 to $250 (and the $250 payment could disappear completely on December 31).  It was against the advice of social policy experts and economists, ostensibly done to ween people off the emergency-level payment and encourage people to start looking for work again.  The decision pushed 370,000 people back into poverty, according to modelling from The Australia Institute.	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-04/coronavirus-government-policy-jobkeeper-jobseeker-unemployment/12729136

The blog posts, written years before he was in the public eye, contain disturbing insights into the worldview which has shaped his politics, and even brought him convictions for 'disturbing religious worship' and 'ethnic agitation' for which he was fined by the Finnish Supreme Court.   Among hundreds of blog posts over the years, Halla-aho wrote in June 2006 that Islam is a "religion of pedophiles," and the Prophet Mohammed "was a pedophile."  He said that "robbing passers-by" was a "genetic trait" of Somalis.   In 2006 he implied he would be "exclusively happy if a 'gang of immigrants' raped" a Green party MP.   "I still and will continue to sincerely and wholeheartedly believe that if a woman who opposes the deportation of immigrant rapists is raped by an immigrant rapist, it is a happy thing," he later wrote.	https://www.euronews.com/2023/06/20/racism-and-rape-fantasies-the-pr-headache-facing-finlands-new-right-wing-government

The law, which one of its sponsors in the Texas state Senate called the most significant ban on diversity offices in higher education in the country, comes as the U.S. Supreme Court later this month is widely expected to ban colleges and universities from considering race as a factor in their admissions decisions.  Under the Texas law, signed by Abbott on Wednesday, any public college or university that does not certify it is in compliance with the measure would not be able to spend state funds allocated to it.  It also mandates that state officials every two years through 2029 conduct studies to gauge the impact of the law on students broken down by race. It will look at the rates of application, acceptance, matriculations, retention and graduation, along with grade point averages. The law does not explain the reasoning for conducting these studies.	https://www-nbcnews-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna89694

Medically, Shamshirsaz knew what the right course of action was, but legally, there was nothing he could do. He sent her home, telling her to return if she developed a fever or chills.   When a few days later, the woman came back, she was in severe danger. She had developed septic shock, a condition that involves extremely low blood pressure, mental confusion and, in some cases, organ failure and death. They cared for her in the intensive care unit for two weeks. Shamshirsaz said the infection was so severe that the patient’s kidneys suffered permanent damage. She would require an organ transplant within a year or so to stay alive.  All of this, he knew, could have been avoided if the patient had been able to get an abortion when she came in the first time.

It appeared she may have been seeing her disability as the cause, yet I saw she was trying to use the handsaw incorrectly. It wasn't her disability holding her back, it was her mindset.

The study, done by combining the Socio-Economic and Caste Census or SECC (2012) data and the data from the Economic Census (2013), noted that this pattern of segregation is very similar to how people belonging to SC communities live in rural areas.  Its title is ‘Residential Segregation and Unequal Access to Local Public Services in India: Evidence from 1.5m Neighborhoods’. It was done by Sam Asher, Kritarth Jha, Paul Novosad, Anjali Adukia, and Brandon Tan.  The study also found that public services such as piped water, closed drainage, schools and health clinics within cities were systematically located away from neighbourhoods where marginalised groups like SCs and Muslims lived.	https://thewire.in/urban/urban-neighborhoods-mirror-rural-areas-in-segregation-of-scs-and-muslim-communities-study

This had the paradoxical effect of making the gay Black male candidate more desirable as a candidate (to White people) than the heterosexual Black male candidate. Thus, being gay functioned as a “disarming mechanism” similar to the Teddy Bear Effect, which shows that babyfaced Black men have an advantage because they appear warmer and more docile.	https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertwlivingston_pride-pridemonth-lgbtq-activity-7077639316293734403-vqRe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android

Rather than abide by its treaties, which the US constitution calls the “supreme law of the land”, the federal government allowed gold prospectors and settlers to overrun the Black Hills and surrounding area.  Members of the Great Sioux Nation were forced to surrender most of their territory and move to much smaller reservations on what was deemed useless land by the US government. Decades later, the busts of four US presidents – two slave owners and two who were hostile toward Native Americans – were chiseled into the holy mountain the Lakota called “Tunkasila Sakpe”, the Six Grandfathers.	https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/03/mount-rushmore-south-dakota-indigenous-americans

While the players conducted their on-court warm-ups, drunken fans unleashed some racially fueled heckles at the Globetrotters. According to the book Sport: Race, Ethnicity and Identity, point guard Runt Pullins huddled the team together and suggested that the best way to shut up "these wise guys" was to absolutely dominate and embarrass the local team they had to play that night.   And that's what they did, running up the score to a ridiculous 112 to 5. That only angered the crowd more, and to pacify the increasingly raucous and possibly violent fans in the stands, the team calmed them down with basketball tricks. Runt Pullins smiled as he dribbled the ball between his legs, Inman Jackson threw a pass behind his back to Kid Oliver, who tossed up the ball and caught it on his neck, then rolled it down his arm. From that night on, coach Abe Saperstein told players to incorporate the tricks into the games, particularly as it could settle down audiences uncomfortable and hostile to the notion of a dominant team of African-Americans.	https://www.grunge.com/200929/the-untold-truth-of-the-harlem-globetrotters/

Black cricket has been failed and the ECB must develop a plan to revive it. Many who experience discrimination do not report it because of a distrust in the authorities.

Behind the scenes, A&M spent weeks altering the terms of her job. After hearing about the concerns, McElroy agreed to a five-year contract position without tenure, which would have avoided a review by regents. On Sunday, she received a third offer, this time with a one-year contract and emphasizing that the appointment was at will and that she could be terminated at any time. She has rejected the offer and shared all of the offer letters with the Tribune.	https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/11/texas-a-m-kathleen-mcelroy-journalism/

Unlike Europe, southeast Asia isn’t a region that’s been well studied by archaeologists. Also, some locations in the region that might harbor a rich fossil record are now submerged under the sea.  “Island Southeast Asia is still relatively underrepresented. However this may change in the future given the increased interest in the region. Our study, together with the recent discoveries on Homo luzonensis and Homo floresiensis, brings Island Southeast Asia at the forefront of research in human evolutionary history,” said Maximilian Larena, study author and researcher at Uppsala University.	https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/16/world/denisovan-dna-philippines-scn/index.html

In 2017, Khan – then a law student – published Amazon's Antitrust Paradox in the Yale Law Journal. It was a brilliant, blistering analysis showing how the Reagan-era theory of antitrust (which celebrates monopolies as "efficient") had failed on its own terms, using Amazon as Exhibit A of the ways in which post-Reagan antitrust had left Americans vulnerable to corporate abuse:  https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox  The paper sent seismic shocks through both legal and economic circles, and goosed the neo-Brandeisian movement (sneeringly dismissed as "hipster antitrust"). This movement is a rebuke to Reaganomics, with its celebration of monopolies, trickle-down, offshoring, corporate dark money, revolving-door regulatory capture, and companies that are simultaneously too big to fail and too big to jail.	https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/14/making-good-trouble/#the-peoples-champion

The findings, which are undergoing peer review at a journal, show that gendered age biases are still alive and thriving in many workplaces.   What Diehl, Dzubinski and Stephenson discovered is that there is no mythical “prime” working age or “sweet spot” for professional women. Women under 40 in the study saw their experience and credibility dismissed because of their age, while women between 40 and 60 ― what the study considered middle age ― continued to experience gendered ageism, too.	https://www-huffpost-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.huffpost.com/entry/age-discrimination-women_l_64ac0fe0e4b02fb0e6f9d516/amp

Besides copious amounts of data, the book provides revealing vignettes of the experiences of women in science, along with telling examples of institutional practices, both past and present. Nature, for instance, used the phrase ‘men of science’ in its mission statement until the year 2000, and did not have a female editor-in-chief until 2018. My favourite example, also from 2018, concerns Donna Strickland, physicist at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who received a share of the Nobel prize in physics that year for her work on short-pulsed lasers. At the time, she was an associate professor whose Wikipedia entry had just been rejected on the grounds that she didn’t meet the online encyclopedia’s notability criteria.	https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02139-x

For a PhD student working on their thesis, that can mean spending up to 19 additional working days per year just reading papers.  English is the language of science – but precision is tough as a non-native speaker  These statistics, published today in PLoS Biology1, might not be shocking, researchers say, but it’s important to measure the effects of language barriers on the careers of academics who are not fluent in English. It “is the first step for the scientific community to make more effort to tackle this problem”, says Tatsuya Amano, a biodiversity researcher at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, and a co-author of the study.	https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02320-2

7/31/2023 9:20:13	World Day for Safety and Health at Work 2013: Case Study: Karoshi: Death from overwork	Karoshi is a Japanese word meaning death from overwork. This term has been used since the 1970s. In 1978 there was a report on 17 karoshi cases at the 51st annual meeting of the Japan Association of Industrial Health. Karoshi is not a pure medical term but a sociomedical term that refers to fatalities or associated work disability due to cardiovascular attacks (such as brain strokes, myocardial infarction or acute cardiac failure) aggravated by a heavy workload and long working hours. The phenomenon was first identified in Japan, and the word is now adopted internationally. The media have frequently used the word because it emphasizes the sudden deaths (or disabilities) caused by overwork which should be compensated. Karoshi has become an important social problem in Japan.  Here are some typical cases of Karoshi: Mr A worked at a major snack food processing company for as long as 110 hours a week (not a month) and died from heart attack at the age of 34. His death was approved as work-related by the Labour Standards Office. Mr B, a bus driver, whose death was also approved as work-related, worked more than 3,000 hours a year. He did not have a day off in the 15 days before he had stroke at the age of 37. Mr C worked in a large printing company in Tokyo for 4,320 hours a year including night work and died from stroke at the age of 58. His widow received a workers’ compensation 14 years after her husband’s death. Ms D, a 22 year-old nurse, died from a heart attack after 34 hours’ continuous duty five times a month.	https://www.ilo.org/safework/info/publications/WCMS_211571/lang--en/index.htm

The slurs eventually led to a dispute, an NYPD spokesperson told CNN.  The argument escalated and a man stabbed Sibley, said Pena, who witnessed the incident and put pressure on Sibley’s wound. Sibley, who was stabbed in the torso, was taken to Maimonides Medical Center where he was pronounced dead, according to police.	https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/02/entertainment/oshae-sibley-dancer-beyonce-tribute/index.html

So our justice movements must hold space for grief.   There is healing in grieving together. To remember the fallen and those harmed by these oppressive structures. To cultivate our fierceness and determination. To plan actions to tear it all down. To build anew.   Grief can be a powerful motivator as can anger when given the space it needs to breathe. It is the fertilizer for our growth towards a better way to be.   Always be horrified by the mass death and disabling happening due to the eugenic handling of the pandemic, from the heat waves and climate change disasters, from the capitalist work, from the oppressive horrors many of us face daily.   Take that horror, anger, and grief and forge it into a weapon to strike down the oppressive systems.   And while we fight, let us also cultivate our networks of mutual aid and solidarity. We can do both, and there are many roles for us all to fill to realize this.  #Justice #Grief #MutualAid #StopNormalizingMassDeath	https://ni.hil.ist/@TheBird/110816594391815471

While the presence of White women in DEI leadership may be seen by some as a testament to the progress we've made in addressing gender inequality, it also inadvertently casts a shadow on the very principles of DEI.  In an ideal world, the diversity of decision-making individuals should reflect the diversity of those they represent.  However, we live in a world where societal constructs and systemic biases skew these demographics. So, for me, the question arises: How can white women working in DEI encourage and facilitate broader representation and true equity? Will they? And how do we begin to hold them accountable? Is it even possible?	https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7093229100579885057/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android

But the left really need to wrap their heads around the fact that money doesn't grow on rich people: there isn't less of it because rich people have more, and taxing their wealth away won't raise additional revenue for social expenditure. That's simply not how public finance works.  If your government isn't spending in ways that benefit society, that's because they've made a political decision to avoid doing so, not because billionaires have all the money! This PAYGO model of public finance makes taking action on anything - including existential threats such as climate change - impossible. Until progressives realise that the government can always spend any amount, immediately, society will continue to hurtle towards disaster.  We do not need the rich to help us solve our problems.  #LearnMMT	https://firefish.social/notes/9i1miayjs19suiyh

In this paper, we identify the scheme used to assign usernames for each post written by an anonymous user on EJMR. We show how the statistical properties of that algorithm do not anonymize posts, but instead allows the IP address from which each post was made to be determined with high probability.”	https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/diversity-equity/2023/07/20/study-says-it-found-ip-addresses-anonymous-ejmr

She lives in the home her parents purchased in 1958, a prized possession which, after each hurricane, has become increasingly expensive to protect with home insurance.  In 2021, she was paying $3,035 (£2,386) annually. After her insurer stopped writing new policies in her neighbourhood, in 2022, the quote she received from the state-backed plan was more than triple that amount - $9,876 - a sum she could not afford.  "To pay insurance would be taking away from food on my table, right now," says Ms Bradford, who relies on disability insurance for her income.	https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66367224

Yet poverty levels are breaking all records. It’s a paradoxical situation: almost 15 million Britons are considered poor these days, although there’s almost full employment. The reason: inflation and high energy costs.  Galloping inflation and a dramatic spike in energy costs in recent months are forcing millions of Britons into poverty. Wages fluctuate in an "uberized” working world of precarious employment conditions. Over the past 10 years, beginning with David Cameron, the government has scaled back its support to vulnerable members of society. The result: reduced life expectancy. Disadvantaged Britons are dying 10 years sooner than their wealthier compatriots - victims of what’s become known as the "shit life syndrome” - a life marked by poor living conditions, disease and addiction.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK68yyrKUOA

TAB to move forwards. SHIFT + TAB to move backwards.   2) Interactive elements Can you move the focus to all elements in the website? Can you activate it?  TAB moves forwards SHIFT + TAB moves backwards ENTER opens links SPACE or ENTER activates a button ARROW KEYS to select option * links, buttons, radio buttons, checkboxes, input fields, text areas   3) Modal Can you close the modal? (using ESC key or close button) Where does the focus go after closing it? (it should go back to the element that opened it) If you use TAB key inside modal, does the focus goes back to page content without closing modal?  4) Main Menu Can you open a submenu? Can you close it? Can you navigate to all items in the submenu? Does the tabbing order makes sense? Can you skip the navigation? (skip navigation hidden link) Repeat for Mobile / Tablet view   5) Form elements Can you submit the form? Can you edit the fields? Can you autocomplete common fields? (name, address, password, etc) Does the focus goes to the first error field after submit? Are the required fields indicated?

A fifth C is the darker side of our nature: Control."   The essay discusses Paulo Freire's discussion of what dialogue is, how essential dialogue is for liberation, and how we must use problem-solving education to help us learn from each other and cooperate in finding solutions.   An excerpt: "To be conscious requires us to critically think, but to critically think, we need to learn how to problem-solve, to be creative, to explore who we are and our relation to others and our environment. We need to return to the roots of our humanity, the 4 C’s, which requires education to be based in problem-solving not ‘banking.’  Problem-solving methodology is rooted in dialogue between teacher and student, where they consent to the material, critically think and discuss material, and learn from each other. Dialogue cannot be forced, else it ceases to be dialogue and becomes lecturing at best and abuse at worst. We cannot speak for another, as that takes away the person’s voice, and thus fails to be dialogue. Dialogue must meet the other with an open mind, else it ceases to be dialogue and becomes a projection of our assumptions and/or refusal to account for our own biases."  #PauloFreire #PedagogyOfTheOppressed #Education #Liberation #Dialogue	https://ni.hil.ist/@TheBird/110856009446898214

Don’t let these laws fool you - their intention is not to protect women in sports. Their intention is to put women “back in their place”, force them to have s certain type of “feminine look” and eventually shut down certain women sports for being too masculine.  These laws hurt ALL women. All of us. Cis and trans, athletes or not.	https://toot.cat/@catzilla/110871124370242252

That truth, which has repeatedly been demonstrated over the course of the pandemic, is one of the key takeaways from the 2023 California Health Interview Survey of more than 5,000 adults, teenagers and children across the state conducted in March and April.  The survey found that Latino adults were twice as likely as white adults to have experienced COVID-19 symptoms for two months or longer. Their long COVID rate, 40%, was well above the statewide average of 28% and nearly three times the rate of Asian adults in California.	https://capitalandmain.com/amid-the-new-normal-of-covid-theres-an-old-normal-too

Well-intentioned policymakers have made many attempts to intervene over the past 50 years or so, focusing primarily on addressing gender imbalances using a “just add women and stir” approach.  In Australia this is exemplified by the Gender Matters policy suite from Screen Australia, which aims to improve the number of women working behind the scenes, and the number of productions telling women’s stories.  Yet while gender inequality is important, it certainly is not all that matters if the ultimate goal is a safe, equitable and inclusive workplace. Instead, we need to take a detailed view of who works in the Australian film industry, and understand the specific challenges they face.	https://theconversation.com/film-camera-departments-operate-on-a-system-of-who-you-know-so-what-happens-when-youre-not-a-member-of-the-in-group-209786?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=bylinelinkedinbutton

It was March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had reached America, and the pandemic of Ableist Media was in full swing.   I am in a unique position. I am both disabled and a professional communicator. Not only have I spent my entire life dissecting every conversation I’ve had or will have out of anxiety, but I have also decided to make a career out of it. In college I began taking media studies where my professors allowed me the opportunity to evaluate disability. I soon came to realize not only were disability stereotypes pervasive, but they often dictated how people would treat and react to me — and how much they would think my life was worth.  When it comes to ableism, non-disabled people are fairly predictable and uncreative. So, watching as the media repeated over and over that the “healthy” had nothing to fear from the virus, my stomach was pitted with dread. We would never be free of COVID-19.	https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10645352/covid-19-and-the-pandemic-of-ableist-media

Often described as "unbanked", this group comprises undocumented workers and others who lack identification, such as newly arrived migrants.  "In the absence of cash, they are going to really struggle," Dr Berg says.  In Sweden, one of the first nations in the world to embrace a cash-free economy, concerns about financial exclusion among marginalised communities saw a backlash against the shift to cashlessness, particularly when many bank branches removed cash-handling facilities altogether.  Many now believe Sweden went too hard too early, removing cash-handling infrastructure that is hard to replace and leaving these vulnerable groups behind.

I was in Africa just once in my life - on a package holiday,” says Konrad Erben, a student in Jena. Nevertheless, many people insist Erben can’t be German because he is Black. But Afro-Germans have been living in Germany for a long time. Hundreds came from German colonies during the Imperial period. Some appeared in spectacles known as "Völkerschauen.” Others came to get an education. Mandenga Diek was the first African to become a German citizen in 1896. A successful salesman, he campaigned for civil rights with an organization called the "Afrikanischer Hilfsverein.” It marked the beginning of an organization for the Black community in Germany.   During the Nazi period, Afro-Germans were misused in propaganda films. For example, they played alongside Heinz Rühmann in the film "Quax in Africa.” Many were also subject to forced sterilization and imprisoned in concentration camps. After World War II, black US troops had relationships with German women in occupied Germany. Their children were put up for adoption in the United States. Those who remained were marginalized by racists daily. A former member of the German national soccer team, Erwin Kostedde, recalls his experiences in this film. Gabriela Willbold became the first black child to attend school in Cottbus. She took the anti-racist assertions of Communist East Germany literally and refused to tolerate any discrimination.    In "Black and German,” four generations of men and women speak of their moving, rousing and proud history.

Now someone has put this guy surnamed Patel in charge to sort things out, another coon. No offence, but it’s in the Oxford dictionary. It’s all so ridiculous, all out of proportion.”  As appalling as it is to watch him read it aloud, it encapsulates how dire things are, and there is an added layer of awfulness where abuse comes with the disclaimer that you are being ridiculous if you make it into a big deal. Rafiq’s brief appearance in the documentary, where he testifies before the Department for Culture, Media and Sport committee in 2022, also leads to its most shocking twist. Thirteen months after first making the allegations in front of the committee, Rafiq says: “All that’s changed really is my family have been driven out of the country.” Incredibly, Lord Patel, who was hired to help Yorkshire recover from the scandal, faced so much abuse that it contributed to him leaving the UK, too.	https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/19/is-cricket-racist-review-the-answer-can-only-be-one-thing-very

8/27/2023 17:24:31	The strange, secretive world of North Korean science fiction | Ars Technica	The success of the Sputnik 1 mission meant that the Americans were no longer controlling the sky, a powerful message for North Koreans who remembered that the US Air Force bombed their country just a few years earlier during the Korean War. According to some estimates, American jets dropped 635,000 tons of bombs, which included 32,000 tons of napalm. Twelve to 15 percent of the population was killed, and Pyongyang and other major cities were almost reduced to rubble.  To a Western reader, such plots might seem ludicrous, perhaps designed to boost the confidence of a nation with little contact with the rest of the world. However, exploring them deeper might reveal a more nuanced layer of understanding.  "When I read Change Course, I find myself constantly thinking: If I were watching this same story as a Hollywood movie and the protagonists were Americans, my reaction would be very different," said researcher Benoît Berthelier, lecturer at the University of Sydney, who published several papers on Korean literature. "When you experience familiar plot structures and tropes but with the protagonists and antagonists reversed, there's a distancing effect that makes you question why only certain configurations of good and bad roles feel uncontroversial."	https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/08/the-strange-secretive-world-of-north-korean-science-fiction/?utm_brand=arstechnica&utm_social-type=owned&utm_source=mastodon&utm_medium=social

It can involve traffic jams, airport queues and stress. Even so, most of us look forward to going away for the change of scenery and break from our everyday routines.  For autistic children, though, these changes in environment and routine can be difficult to cope with. And our research suggests that this can make their family holidays extremely fraught affairs.  Some of the British parents we spoke to said the challenges of taking their autistic children away on holiday were so great that they would only go on short trips (35% only ever spent one or two nights away). Many did their best to avoid peak travel times and other situations in which their child might become overstimulated.  A large majority (over 80%) only ever took their holidays in the UK, rather than going abroad. Some said they chose not to go away on holiday at all, and took day trips instead to avoid overnight stays.	https://theconversation.com/how-the-tourism-industry-and-other-travellers-can-help-families-of-autistic-children-get-the-break-they-deserve-180715

9/6/2023 15:09:43	Power analysis in health policy and systems research: a guide to research conceptualisation	Power is a growing area of study for researchers and practitioners working in the field of health policy and systems research (HPSR). Theoretical development and empirical research on power are crucial for providing deeper, more nuanced understandings of the mechanisms and structures leading to social inequities and health disparities; placing contemporary policy concerns in a wider historical, political and social context; and for contributing to the (re)design or reform of health systems to drive progress towards improved health outcomes. Nonetheless, explicit analyses of power in HPSR remain relatively infrequent, and there are no comprehensive resources that serve as theoretical and methodological starting points. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a consolidated guide to researchers wishing to consider, design and conduct power analyses of health policies or systems. This practice article presents a synthesis of theoretical and conceptual understandings of power; describes methodologies and approaches for conducting power analyses; discusses how they might be appropriately combined; and throughout reflects on the importance of engaging with positionality through reflexive praxis. Expanding research on power in health policy and systems will generate key insights needed to address underlying drivers of health disparities and strengthen health systems for all.	https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/6/11/e007268.full.pdf

I reminded myself that neither scholars nor journalists can be expected to cite all the articles or books on a particular topic. There are too many books and articles to choose from, so, at some point, we stop reading to actually start writing. Also, we can make mistakes and miss work that can be included. We're all fallible after all.  But then I became increasingly unsettled. After all, I've written one of several books on the topic. And still, I tried to underplay what happened. I did what was expected of me as a woman to not take offense where I probably should and move along.  Mine was not the only omission; leading feminist theorist Dr. Sara Ahmed's work was also not mentioned (though her resignation from an academic post does appear as a case study in the piece). While I was curious and increasingly uncomfortable about my book being overlooked, I was downright shocked and angry that Ahmed was left out. Her groundbreaking work analyzes sexism and racism in the academy and deeply influences my own. I couldn't have written Sexism Ed without reading her work. I've cited her again and again in both the book and my essays.	https://www.wihe.com/article-details/124/citation-matters/

Once those needs are met, they move on to the need for safety and security. The needs become progressive, advancing to love and intimacy and then self-esteem before reaching self-actualization. The highest level is where humans are self-aware and grow to achieve their individual potential.  “This is a rip-off from the Blackfoot nation,” University of Alberta professor Cindy Blackstock told her workshop audience on Wednesday.  Blackstock, a member of the Gitksan First Nation, serves as executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada. With 25 years of social work experience in child protection and indigenous rights, her promotion of cultural-based and evidence-informed solutions has been recognized by the Nobel Women’s Initiative and the Aboriginal Achievement Foundation.	https://lincolnmichel.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/maslows-hierarchy-connected-to-blackfoot-beliefs/

Having to listen to white people talk over us about the importance of listening to our voices is a particularly insidious form of white violence.  I wrote a long time ago about the damage that is done when we are talked about and debated by non-Indigenous people and, in that process, dehumanised:  … the inevitable removing of Indigenous people from the dialogue in favour of another round of ‘Who are the real racists?’. By removing us as having an active role in the dialogue it acts to make us both object and subject of other people’s discussion, and not active initiators or participants within the discussion. When this happens it doesn’t really matter which side of the political spectrum people are arguing from, whether those people are arguing that the demonisation is fair comment or that we need to be saved, or both, the damage is done. We are not equals asserting ourselves and engaging in a dialogue, we are a problem that white people need to solve ‘by any means necessary’ with, or more typically without, us.	https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/04/yes-or-no-when-the-voice-vote-is-over-indigenous-australians-will-have-to-come-together

But don't assume you know what the audience wants  It wouldn’t be the last time that Hughes encountered blatant racism in her career. At a BBC radio gig, a producer asked her not to do “any Black material”. In 2013, after complaining to her co-agent that she wasn’t getting many auditions, he told her: “Black people just aren’t in this year.” They parted ways soon after. For the next five years, Hughes’s career reads like an endless game of snakes and ladders. One minute she’d be on the brink of breaking through, the next she was back at the bottom of the heap. Meanwhile, her white male contemporaries soared, appearing on the TV panel shows that kept turning her down.	https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marciaore_comedian-london-hughes-i-made-more-money-activity-7101196807656890370-Wz2h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android

If you're white, cisgender, heterosexual, not disabled, and nominally Christian, you are not currently on the menu—but you will be. When the machine has eaten the rest of us, it will turn on you.

Maybe next will be people who are left-handed. Maybe people with freckles after that. Their reasons don't have to make sense—they never have.  It's not about reason.  It's about hate.

It was the first World Cup that Spain had qualified for and an exit at the group stages was a disappointing outcome for everyone. What happened next might seem shocking but, to the players, it was just another example of the broken relationship and toxic attitudes they’d become used to living with. Soon after, they would come together to fight for change — just as we’ve seen happen this year.  “I still remember what one of the top RFEF officials told us after we were knocked out,” says Vero Boquete, a key player of the time and still an icon of women’s football in Spain.  “He said: ‘This is how you pay us back for getting you here — wasting our time instead of us being with our families so that you can enjoy yourselves for a while?’	https://theathletic.com/4838138/2023/09/07/spain-quereda-rfef-rubiales-vilda-world-cup-2015/

A large-sample Canadian study indicated that college grades and graduation outcomes of disabled students are mostly identical to those of other students, and there is no reason to discourage them from pursuing challenging careers. In many countries—for example, Germany—the levels of educational achievement are higher for disabled people than for the rest of the population. This means that when organizational hiring and promotion practices are biased against disabled people, a significant talent pool is excluded.	https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/positively-different/202309/debunking-the-disability-employment-myths

Right now, that’s as complex as you could possibly imagine | Maria Rashed | The Guardian	#Israel #Palestine #Hamas #HumanRights #Apartheid #WarCrimes: "Supporting Palestine does not equate to antisemitism – advocating for ending Israeli aggression against Palestine doesn’t imply forgetting the historical experiences and pain of the Jewish people. Today, Zionism’s goals come at the cost of Arab lives, leaving us feeling insecure, afraid to voice our opinions and hesitant to empathise with our suffering people. Reflecting on recent events, Israeli citizens have protested against their own government’s shift towards dictatorship.  Being an Arab in Israel involves understanding the language and history of the “other side”. This phrasing highlights the oppressor-oppressed dynamic, with one side having one of the most powerful armies in the world and the other being a minority. Therefore, when discussing recent events, we cannot ignore the years of occupation and invasion, and how Israel has treated Arabs. This is not to justify Hamas’s actions but to provide context for Palestinians’ pain and suffering without protection.  Ultimately, the people pay the price from all sides. With rising global support for Israel, I fear for innocent Palestinians. Those in power are to blame. Now is the time for people to unite against oppressive governments. Palestine should be freed not only from the oppressive Israeli regime but also from the influence of Hamas, and its conservative, chauvinistic ideology."	https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/22/palestinian-citizen-israel-without-supporting-hamas?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other

Robinson is celebrated as the first African-American to break the so-called color line and play in Major League Baseball. While Robinson was certainly an exceptional baseball player, framing the story this way depicts him as racially special. The subtext is that Robinson was the first black athlete strong enough to overcome the barriers preventing blacks from competing with whites; no black athletes before him were skilled enough to do so. While this tagline elevates Robinson as an individual, it implicitly positions African-Americans overall as inferior. It also falsely propagates the belief that racism in sports ended with Robinson, implying that current struggles against racism in sports are unnecessary.	https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/white-people-are-still-raised-be-racially-illiterate-if-we-ncna906646

In all of our work, we control for characteristics that might affect promotion and success in the public service.  Even after accounting for these things, large discrepancies remain.  The results on ethnic diversity are particularly unsettling:  Public servants from NESB face lower promotion prospects throughout their careers, irrespective of when they migrated to Australia — or even if they were born in Australia or arrived here before kindergarten. APS staff from English-speaking backgrounds are around 30% more likely to be promoted to senior analyst, 40% more likely to be promoted to management and 60% more likely to be promoted to senior executive service (SES). Staff from Asian backgrounds suffer the most significant promotion deficits, while European-born individuals of NESB experience only slightly better outcomes. This discrepancy suggests that the prospects for staff from Asian backgrounds are partly due to factors other than language and that ethnicity inhibits promotion within the APS. Our research suggests promotion prospects for NESB staff have not improved over the two-decade period our study covered. If anything, their situation has worsened.	https://www.themandarin.com.au/233246-promotions-diversity-in-the-aps-shows-case-for-urgent-reform/

Imagine being tasked with enforcing the law, but also being able to rely on the legal system’s leniency when you commit crimes on citizens that citizens, especially Black people, would have suffered harsher penalties for, especially if they committed said crime in a police officer. Then you get to cry “blue lives matter” while completely ignoring the fact that cops are already treated like a protected class.  For example, in May 2020, during civil unrest over the murder of George Floyd, a former Minneapolis police officer fired projectiles at a group of people who were just standing around. That officer also beat the hell out of a Black man who was not resisting arrest. Obviously, this is the type of behavior that could land a person, especially a Black person, in jail and have them looking at significant prison time. That cop will spend a paltry 15 days in a county facility that is not a jail.	https://newsone.com/4770849/justin-steton-sentenced/

And yet, when Pinkett Smith’s memoir Worthy also deals with sensitive subject matter, it is prematurely deemed a ‘flop’ by Newsweek and criticized for bearing “eyebrow-raising admissions.” Comments under Pinkett Smith’s social media posts are racially charged, with one user describing her book as “affirmation for the immoral behavior of Jezebel Pinkett Smith.” Another user mocks her by saying, “there’s a difference between being a heroine and being on heroin.” 	https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/10/11568006/jada-pinkett-smith-celebrity-memoir-backlash

It serves no one but the capitalist enterprise so that the biz appear progressive and inclusive without actually challenging the exploitative nature of the system itself.

An anonymous Amazon employee called it the “holy grail” if it actually worked.  But it didn’t. After the company trained the algorithm on 10 years of its own hiring data, the algorithm reportedly became biased against female applicants. The word “women,” like in women’s sports, would cause the algorithm to specifically rank applicants lower. After Amazon engineers attempted to fix that problem, the algorithm still wasn’t up to snuff and the project was ended.  Amazon’s story has been a wake-up call on the potential harm machine learning systems could cause if not deployed without fully considering their social and legal implications. But Amazon wasn’t the only company working on this technology, and companies who want to embrace it without the proper safeguards could face legal action for an algorithm they can’t explain.	https://qz.com/1427621/companies-are-on-the-hook-if-their-hiring-algorithms-are-biased

How has the Palestinian cause been helped by this violence? How can anyone defend the slaughter of young music lovers at a music festival? Do you defend Hamas? They probably expected a defensive reaction from him, but calmly, in his smooth Australian-accented English, my friend had already turned the interview on its head. “I want to know why I’m here today, and why I haven’t been here for the past year,” he said gently. By the eve of October 7, he pointed out, Israeli forces had already killed more than two hundred Palestinians in 2023. The siege in Gaza was more than sixteen years old, and Israel had been operating outside international law for seventy-five years. “Normal” in Palestine was a killing a day—yet a killing a day in a decades-old occupation was hardly news; it certainly wasn’t justification for a live interview on a national television network. Palestinians were being given the opportunity to speak now because the Western media suddenly cared, and they cared (“as we should care,” my friend added) because, this time, the victims included Israeli civilians.	https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/no-human-being-can-exist/

They identified that racism has detrimental effects on health and wellbeing. Not all were clear regarding what constituted racism: it was not described as an ideology created to justify colonial distribution of power and resources. Some thought that racism was individual prejudice while others noted it was also structural in nature. Participants commonly defined race as involving physical or cultural differences, suggesting that discredited historical and colonial concepts of race continue in Australian society. While many felt that education was the best way to reduce racism and its impacts, some participants noted that being educated did not necessarily change racist behaviour.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953623007219?via%3Dihub

Although outcomes based on race may document some general paths of improvement, progress and success can be appreciably uneven across people who are the same race. Even though skin tone is a linchpin of intraracial disparities, connections between colorism and educational outcomes are underappreciated. A brief consideration of how color-based advantages and disadvantages may affect African-, Latino/a-, and Asian-descended groups is provided to heighten educators' awareness of the problem.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00405841.2016.1116847

Colorism, or skin color stratification, is a process that privileges light-skinned people of color over dark in areas such as income, education, housing, and the marriage market. This essay describes the experiences of African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans with regard to skin color. Research demonstrates that light-skinned people have clear advantages in these areas, even when controlling for other background variables. However, dark-skinned people of color are typically regarded as more ethnically authentic or legitimate than light-skinned people. Colorism is directly related to the larger system of racism in the USA and around the world. The color complex is also exported around the globe, in part through US media images, and helps to sustain the multibillion-dollar skin bleaching and cosmetic surgery industries.	https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00006.x

When the 61-year-old Canadian was hospitalized in June 2019 over fears he might be suicidal, he asked his brother to “bust him out” as soon as possible.   Within a month, Nichols submitted a request to be euthanized and he was killed, despite concerns raised by his family and a nurse practitioner.  His application for euthanasia listed only one health condition as the reason for his request to die: hearing loss.  Nichols’ family reported the case to police and health authorities, arguing that he lacked the capacity to understand the process and was not suffering unbearably _ among the requirements for euthanasia. They say he was not taking needed medication, wasn’t using the cochlear implant that helped him hear, and that hospital staffers improperly helped him request euthanasia.  “Alan was basically put to death,” his brother Gary Nichols said.	https://globalnews.ca/news/9052672/canada-euthanasia-laws-disabled/

Amir Farsoud lives with never-ending agony from a back injury years ago. He tells CityNews at its worst he is “crying like a 5-year-old and not sleeping for days in a row.” Farsoud also takes medication for depression and anxiety.  He describes his quality of life as “awful, non-existent and terrible … I do nothing other than manage pain.”  But Farsoud said his quality of life is not the reason he is applying for MAiD. He applied because he is currently in danger of losing his housing and fears being homeless over dying. “It’s not my first choice.”  “I don’t want to die but I don’t want to be homeless more than I don’t want to die,” shared Farsoud.  “I know, in my present health condition, I wouldn’t survive it anyway. It wouldn’t be at all dignified waiting, so if that becomes my two options, it’s pretty much a no-brainer,” said Farsoud.	https://toronto.citynews.ca/2022/10/13/medical-assistance-death-maid-canada/

The introduction of mandatory disclosure is the next step in this journey."  Chief executive of anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out Tony Burnett said mandatory diversity reporting is a "step in the right direction" but believes sanctions should be introduced for clubs that fail to meet targets.  "Now is the time to be bolder," he said. "We would urge the Premier League, EFL and all its 92 clubs to make that data transparent.  "But we also need sanctions for non-compliance and future diversity targets baked into FA, Premier League and EFL rules. Without that commitment, we won't know the true scale of the challenge nor be able to find solutions to make football more representative of the people who love the game."  The new mandatory rule, which will require clubs to report data on age, sex, gender, ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation within their organisations, is set to come into force for the start of the 2024-25 season.	https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67496388

"He said, 'Whenever you go into the White House and go under that awning of the West Wing to go in to see the president, you should whisper in your own ear, this may be the last time that I'm going to be walking into this building. Because you may have to tell the president an inconvenient truth they don't like to hear, which means you may not get asked back again.

Slavery in the USA and the Americas and European colonialism around the globe help explain the historical roots of colorism in the USA. Research on skin tone stratification demonstrates that, with few exceptions, light skin tone is privileged and rewarded in many different social settings. In fact, with increased access to racial capital and media technology, it is not unreasonable to suggest that skin tone is more important than ever.	https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-4608-4_16

The truth is, “The Marvels” never really stood a chance. It is the first film in the franchise to be made by a Black female director, Nia DaCosta, and it features three female superheroes: Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel and Teyonah Parris as Captain Monica Rambeau.

(2013) call to focus more research attention on the workplace experiences of marginalized employees. Indeed, the authors raised many valid points concerning the needed contributions of industrial and organizational (I–O) psychology to both research and public policy as it relates to marginalized groups. However, we believe that the authors also missed an opportunity to highlight the workplace discrimination experienced by those individuals who are marginalized by their darker skin tones. This form of discrimination is more commonly known as colorism. Subsequently, our commentary focuses on defining this form of discrimination that is not well known among I–O psychologists, explaining why our field should be concerned with studying colorism, and making recommendations regarding how our field can better study colorism, affect jurisprudence on the issue, and ameliorate colorism's effects in workplace settings.	https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/industrial-and-organizational-psychology/article/abs/colorism-ubiquitous-yet-understudied/A7F8390038E775312B235B06A4A92EEF

Finally, we make recommendations for I–O psychologists in terms of research and advocacy. Overall, we argue that I–O psychologists are missing an opportunity to be at the forefront of understanding and instigating changes that would result in maximizing the fairness and optimization of these often forgotten employees and their experiences in the workplace.	https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/industrial-and-organizational-psychology/article/abs/gone-fishing-io-psychologists-missed-opportunities-to-understand-marginalized-employees-experiences-with-discrimination/02D4E7492EF1CA4989273DB660FEC8D3

The most recent CBC investigation, which calls into question music icon Buffy Sainte-Marie’s Indigenous identity claims, was shocking and hurtful to many. This story comes on the heels of several others — and it’s always the Indigenous community that carries the burden of these revelations.  People want to pretend to be Indigenous when they’re not? Why would they do that?   Perhaps it’s because they have a romanticized view of Indigenous people — the caricature-like depiction of the noble savage, the innocent “children of nature” who were so cruelly treated. Perhaps it’s because of the interest such a declaration of identity garners, and wanting to be at the centre of that. Perhaps it’s the opportunities that are afforded Indigenous people — in an effort to address the historical subjugation of our communities, which led to decades of stagnation, with no way to make a living and no clear reason of why we should even try to. Maybe it’s because of the job opportunities that this sentiment led to.  	https://indiginews.com/first-person/the-supposed-unmasking-of-buffy-sainte-marie-doesnt-bring-vindication-only-more-hurt

But it was only three years ago that Bill Polian, a respected personnel executive and member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, publicly suggested that Jackson switch positions coming out of college, a practice teams commonly used over the decades. Sport being a microcosm of society, discrimination was as real in football as it was in everyday life. Many decision-makers believed Blacks lacked the intelligence and leadership skills to run an offense, and in some cases owners simply did not want someone of color as the face of their franchise. The league even had an informal ban of Black players from 1934 to 1946, and it wasn't until 2001 that an African American was drafted No. 1 overall at quarterback, with Michael Vick going to the Atlanta Falcons.	https://www.nfl.com/news/sidelines/does-race-remain-a-factor-in-the-evaluation-of-nfl-quarterbacks
12/9/2023 15:53:35	NFL is confronting racism, but are Black quarterbacks continuing to be stereotyped? | CNN	The battle for Black quarterbacks begins with entry into the NFL. According to a leading academic, Black quarterbacks have historically found it more difficult being drafted into the league than their White counterparts.  Dr. Judson L. Jeffries, a professor of African American and African studies at the Ohio State University, says Black quarterbacks have been historically perceived as less intelligent, seen instead as simply athletes.  “The knock on Black quarterbacks was they didn’t have the intellect or academics to play the position,” he tells CNN. “They could run, but when it comes to learning a playbook, reading defenses, learning sophisticated schemes, they weren’t able to do that.”  A 2008 quantitative study by Jeffries and Matthew Bigler showed that “draft experts buy into and perpetuate racial stereotypes about Blacks that adversely impact Black college quarterbacks’ chances of matriculating to the National Football League.”  The study also said: “Blacks are consistently rated more negatively in the areas of leadership and intelligence/decision making.”  A 2017 essay by Rockell Brown Burton, a professor of media, and Tristan F. Jones, a contributing writer and journalist, published in the book “Africana Race and Communication,” went as far to say that the “study is evidence of the modernized social construction of Black quarterbacks by mass media, with a primary focus on their physical attributes and descriptions that better resemble auctioned slaves than chosen leaders of men.”	https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/29/sport/nfl-black-quarterbacks-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
12/9/2023 15:54:11	New evidence shows how NFL discriminates against Black QBs	The NFL presents itself as America’s most cutthroat meritocracy. And yet evidence continues to show that teams screw up the single most important decision they make due to racial bias.  From 2010 to 2022, teams were chronically underrating Black quarterbacks in the draft, a new statistical analysis from SFGATE shows.  QBs selected in those drafts had four times better odds of reaching at least one Pro Bowl if they were Black. SFGATE’s analysis found a statistically significant gap between the rate that Black quarterbacks reached the Pro Bowl relative to their peers despite controlling for draft position.   At every stage of the draft, the average Black quarterback outperformed their non-Black peers. In fact, the analysis found that the average Black quarterback was more likely to receive at least one Pro Bowl selection than the average non-Black quarterback selected 66 picks (roughly two rounds) earlier. The evidence strongly suggests that racial bias is blinding teams in the draft process, leading them to prefer inferior quarterbacks as long as they’re not Black.  In other words, Black quarterbacks are penalized in the draft solely for being Black, our analysis suggests, and it’s a penalty that reverberates years into their professional careers.	https://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/nfl-draft-analysis-racial-bias-quarterbacks-18355172.php

An examination of 4,745 attributions used to describe Black and White National Football League quarterback prospects over a 10-year period revealed data patterns that emphasized racial stereotypes. Black quarterbacks were primarily described with words and phrases that emphasized their physical gifts and their lack of mental prowess. Conversely, White quarterbacks were described as less physically gifted, but more mentally prepared for the game and less likely to make mental errors.

It was in the methods section of this scholarship that statistical analyses were discussed in terms of game day penalties that occurred within the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) from the 2006 through the 2015 season. The results illustrated that referees penalized football teams from historically black college and universities (HBCUs) significantly more than football teams from predominantly white institutions (PWIs). An interpretation of this quantitative data was subsequently completed and Expectancy Violations Theory (EVT) was appropriately spotlighted in the discussion section of this study in an effort to assign meaning to the analytics of interest.	https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/intjscs/issue/31947/354042

With around 25 % of Premier League players being from ethnic minority backgrounds, it is arguably one of the world’s most inclusive sports leagues—but is it really as fair as it seems? This analysis looks at the 2011–2012 Premier League season, to investigate whether there existed evidence of forms of racial discrimination against Black, non-White and non-European players during this period. We analyze player data collected from two hundred and ninety players and seventeen teams using logistic regression, to determine how being a Black, non-White or non-European player depends on variables like total number of appearances, number of fouls, number of yellow cards, number of red cards, number of cards awarded by English referees, number of cards awarded by non-English referees, total number of goals scored by the team, and total number of goals scored by the player. Our results show that there does seem to exist some discrepancy between the treatment of non-White and non-European and Black players compared to the sample of White players.	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-013-9932-3

The number of Black head coaches in Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) College Football, however, has remained stagnant and in many years declined (18). Research has stated that the presence of a defined glass ceiling, discrepancies among Blacks and Whites with regard to social capital (social mobility), and factors of intent and interest in becoming coaches have been integral in preventing many Black coaches from pursuing positions as head coaches in college football. Through the use of narrative, this research contributed to the scholarship in this area by providing anecdotal evidence that hurdles still exist for Black coaches, but changes are also occurring that statistics may not reflect. The story of Charlie Friemont, a graduate assistant aspiring to become a college head coach, demonstrates how the aforementioned factors impact his career choices. Many of his experiences align with the previous literature and have impacted him both negatively and positively in his career pursuits. In addition, Charlie’s story introduces a new factor that may impact the trends of this issue in college football.	https://thesportjournal.org/article/tag/service_quality/page/4/

Yet black players regularly make up more than a quarter of professional club squads. The reasons for this apparent under-representation are explored among 1,000 football fans, including players and ex-players, both white and BME. Opinions were solicited via an online research platform http://www.topfan.co.uk, designed and executed by the authors. The findings indicate 56 per cent of respondents believe racism operates at the executive levels of football, i.e. the boardroom. While some accuse club owners and directors of deliberate discrimination, most suspect a form of unwitting or institutional racism in which assumptions about black people's capacities are not analysed and challenged and so continue to circulate. Among the possible remedies to this is the American National Football League's Rooney Rule, which mandates BME candidates’ inclusion on shortlists for senior coaching positions. A third of participants in the research approved of this type of initiative. While black managers are scarce when compared to the number of black players in professional football, their presence is actually an accurate reflection of their number in the total British population. So is the dearth of black managers an under-representation?	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870.2011.595556

More specifically, the article will draw on original interview data with 40 elite level minority coaches in England, France and the Netherlands and identify a series of key constraining factors which have limited the potential for and realization of opportunities for career progression across the transition from playing to coaching in the professional game. In doing so, the article will focus on three main themes identified by interviewees as the most prescient in explaining the ongoing under-representation of minority coaches in the sport: their limited access to and negative experiences of the high level coach education environment; the continued existence of racisms and stereotypes in the professional coaching workplace; and the over-reliance of professional clubs on networks rather than qualifications-based frameworks for coach recruitment. Finally, the article will contextualize these findings from within a critical race theory perspective and will draw clear linkages between patterns of minority coach under-representation, the enactment of processes and practices of institutional racism, and the underlying normative power of hegemonic Whiteness in the sport.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1012690216656807

Thomas, 2012	The Problem. Persisting challenges of inequity in higher education often position Black women as outsiders within their academic environments, resulting in Black women employing strategies that reflect constant negotiation to achieve power, identity, and voice. Black women’s status internationally “at the margins” remains an unexplored leadership style in human resource development (HRD). Being at the margins, domestically or internationally, likely means that Black women everywhere engage in strategies in order to achieve power, identity, and voice. The Solution. Examining the position, perspectives, and leadership strategies of this typically underserved population globally works to deconstruct lingering policies that limit their access to development in higher education institutions. The Stakeholders. The purpose of this article is to present Black women’s unique social and cultural insights in leadership, increase the visibility of their experiences within their academic environments, and inform key educational leaders and HRD practitioners of the persistent barriers Black women encounter.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1523422311436305

Sherman, 2009	In this article, the experiences of Black women educational leaders are highlighted to examine the intersection of race and gender in their leadership experiences and tease out approaches to gender inclusiveness to disrupt the isms (racism, sexism, etc.) in the construction of their leadership. The participants’ transcendence of racial and gender stereotypes became the impetus for developing a leadership style that is inclusive, builds consensus, and is collaborative. This issue is important given the increasing demographic changes in society in which more opportunities for Black women to ascend to leadership roles in professional organizations (e.g., business, higher education, and government) become prevalent.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1523422309351836

However, there does not appear to be a significant increase in the number of Black women in leadership roles within the field (e.g., clinical directors, heads of university and college ABA programs). Since the diversity of providers and leadership in the field is an important factor in effectively meeting the diverse needs of ABA consumers, the lack of Black women leaders in the field can be described as problematic. Identification of the potential barriers some Black women face when pursuing and attaining positions of leadership in the field of ABA, such as a lack of diversity, stereotypes, and insufficient access to mentors and sponsors, may serve as an effective first step to ameliorating the problem. Recommendations to address identified barriers, including a conceptually systemic plan for data collection that includes racial and gender data, paired with the use of reflective practice by ABA practitioners, and additional diversity and inclusion research in the area of organizational behavior management. Recommendations are offered.	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40617-020-00444-9

This study explores the intentional strategies used by non-traditional leaders to obtain and sustain elite leadership positions. While previous research has documented the barriers that limit the advancement of White women and people of colour, this study extends our understanding to the deliberate, intentional strategies outsiders use to negotiate their entrance to and inclusion in elite leadership roles. We use Bourdieu’s concept of habitus and Puwar’s bodies out of place perspective to analyse the ‘performative contortions’ of outsiders who occupy elite roles. Our analysis relies on 32 in-depth interviews with White women and men and women of colour who occupy senior leadership positions in large organizations. Our findings uncover a range of embodied, cultural and interactional strategies outsiders employ to gain entrance to top positions and thus reveal the ways gender and race are embedded in the ‘hidden curriculum’ of elite organizations. The ongoing labour required of organizational outsiders to negotiate their own inclusion sheds light on the continuing failure of current efforts to achieve equity and inclusion among elite leadership ranks.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gwao.12463

From corporate boardrooms to the halls of Congress, from universities to the courts, from religious institutions to philanthropic organizations, men are simply much more likely than women to be leaders. The report examines the environment in which leadership unfolds--in the classroom, in the workplace, and in politics. The academic and popular literature on women's leadership is vast and continuously growing. As a result, it is beyond the scope of this report to offer an exhaustive review. Instead, the authors identify key issues for creating lasting change, focusing on four questions: (1) What is the gender leadership gap? (2) What explains it? (3) What strategies have already helped narrow the leadership gap? and (4) And what can we do about it now? They conclude with recommendations on how to get to gender parity.

Design/methodology/approach A literature review was done. An empirical survey was designed and pre‐tested for face validity, relevance, clarity of items, and ease of administration and response. Two versions of the survey were pilot tested with two focus groups.  Findings The analysis centered on racial differences between Caucasian and African American female leaders. Chi‐square test was used for the primary original data, and t‐test for the mean subgroup scores obtained in Likert‐type items. The primary finding is that while Caucasian women and African American women face similar gender obstacles, the factors that determine their paths to success differ significantly.  Research limitations/implications The present study provides an excellent starting point to infuse race into the gender equation model regarding female leaders in organizational enterprises. As the world of work becomes more gender and racially diverse, the implications are very important given the status of female leadership in a civil society.  Originality/value The newness and novelty of this paper is the comparison between Caucasian and African American women leaders in the southern part of the USA. The value of this paper is the focus on the demographics of change given the history of gender and racial hostility in organizational life for this segment of the population.	https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09534811211228111/full/html

Before the referendum, I witnessed and experienced extreme racism, on par with someone spitting in my face because I was wearing an always was, always will be shirt - a moment in time I will never forget. Sadly, even after the referendum, disrespect, harm and toxic behaviour persist.  The dark underbelly of our country, with its acceptance of racism, is becoming more evident. Despite the good intentions of many to promote reconciliation and equitable outcomes for First Nations people and communities, our pain and suffering continue.  I'm uncertain of what the future holds for my family, friends and communities in Australia moving forward. I hope and pray that love, compassion and kindness prevail.

But who gets assigned as your co-worker on a team is largely out of the control of new hires.  And for Black women, the number of white co-workers they have on their initial team can potentially make or break their experience at a job, according to a new Harvard Kennedy School working paper published in November.  Elizabeth Linos, an associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard Kennedy School, along with her colleagues Sanaz Mobasseri and Nina Roussille, looked at the job outcomes of 9,037 new hires in a large professional services firm from 2014 to 2020. The study found that Black women who got hired onto whiter teams were more likely to get flagged as “low performers” a year later, and they also saw lower promotion and retention rates.	https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-women-whiter-teams-study_l_655655c8e4b05723e4bc4754?ncid=APPLENEWS00001

We know that there are some extraordinary attitudes at work within the PSF. A PSF Board member once openly expressed the opinion that Anglo cultures always seem to be the ones that take the moral lead around the world, leaving others to follow their example. From any non-western perspective, this is an astounding idea to receive.  In the case of DjangoCon Africa, the first public response to our event on Mastodon was a negative response from a PSF Director, that in effect, cast doubt on the whole idea of a DjangoCon in Tanzania.  That’s not a solitary episode. We understand that (notwithstanding the PSF’s ambition to support Python in Africa) a PSF Director has consistently spoken out against funding for African events, over a period of years.   	https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-software_5.html

Australia is a nation built on racially-based violence towards First Peoples, but there's been some gains for justice and equity.  This is not the case for the state of Israel. As evidenced in this video. As seen in the government's apartheid, ethnic cleansing and genocide.  Antiracism includes naming the racist violence within Israel, especially the government sanctioned violence. Stopping this genocide includes addressing racism.

We contribute to this literature by examining disparities in i) editorial board representation, ii) time spent under review, and iii) citation rates. Using a dataset of 1,000,000 papers from six publishers over the past two decades, we find fewer non-White editors than would be expected based on their share of authorship. Moreover, non-White scientists endure longer waiting times between the submission and acceptance of their manuscripts, and upon publication, their papers receive fewer citations than would be expected based on textual similarity. These findings highlight ways through which non-White scientists suffer from inequalities, potentially hindering their academic careers. Abstract Disparities continue to pose major challenges in various aspects of science. One such aspect is editorial board composition, which has been shown to exhibit racial and geographical disparities. However, the literature on this subject lacks longitudinal studies quantifying the degree to which the racial composition of editors reflects that of scientists. Other aspects that may exhibit racial disparities include the time spent between the submission and acceptance of a manuscript and the number of citations a paper receives relative to textually similar papers, but these have not been studied to date. To fill this gap, we compile a dataset of 1,000,000 papers published between 2001 and 2020 by six publishers, while identifying the handling editor of each paper. Using this dataset, we show that most countries in Asia, Africa, and South America (where the majority of the population is ethnically non-White) have fewer editors than would be expected based on their share of authorship. Focusing on US-based scientists reveals Black as the most underrepresented race. In terms of acceptance delay, we find, again, that papers from Asia, Africa, and South America spend more time compared to other papers published in the same journal and the same year. Regression analysis of US-based papers reveals that Black authors suffer from the greatest delay. Finally, by analyzing citation rates of US-based papers, we find that Black and Hispanic scientists receive significantly fewer citations compared to White ones doing similar research. Taken together, these findings highlight significant challenges facing non-White scientists.	https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2215324120

But beyond those, there is still quite a consistent pattern of discrepancies and inequalities between Canadians who have significant mental or physical disabilities and those of us who do not.”  According to Prince, unemployment rates among Canadians with disabilities “both able and willing to work” are in the 60-to-80-percent ranges.  “We’re struggling again with cutbacks in services for integrating kids in schools, for inclusive classrooms, and we’re seeing cuts in mental-health services,” he said. “But those aren’t just recent; these are long-standing challenges.”  “Pride and prejudice” is the well-worn phrase Prince has employed in Absent Citizens to describe the “ambivalence” of the country, juxtaposing “a fairly generous social policy network” with Canadians’ fear that disclosing a disability to an employer would bring hardship or dismissal.  “Overwhelmingly, when we think of people with handicaps, impairments, or disabilities”¦we tend to think of it in a medical sense—we medicalize people,” Prince said. “So rather than seeing their potentials and their abilities, we emphasize what’s missing: the defect and the deficit. And that usually gets defined in biomedical terms, which usually leads to solutions of very expensive biomedical interventions.”	https://www.straight.com/article-265269/bc-failing-disabled

The photo was connected to the St. Augustine Movement, named for the town in Florida where it took place. Lots of peaceful protests and demonstrations were responded to with violence, which lead to more and more complicated protests.  On June 11, 1964, Martin Luther King, Jr was arrested for trespassing at the Monson Motor Lodge after being asked to leave its segregated restaurant.  This (and other things) helped spur on a group of protesters, black and white, to jump into the pool as a strategically planned event to end segregation at motel pools.  The pool at this motel was designated “white only”. Whites who paid for motel rooms invited blacks to join them in the motel pool as their guests.	https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/motel-manager-pouring-acid-water-black-people-swam-pool-1964/

Saida Bello told a tribunal hearing on Wednesday that “there is institutional racism entrenched deeply in the City of London Corporation” and claimed that almost 200 other employees of colour had also made complaints.  Bello said she had a spreadsheet compiled internally of names of colleagues who had made complaints to the organisation about racism.  “This is the first time this spreadsheet from 186 black and minoritised staff has been exposed,” she told the hearing. “These 186 people on the spreadsheet have tried to have a voice but clearly that hasn’t worked.”	https://amp-theguardian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/firms-former-head-of-diversity-sues-for-race-discrimination

In this review, we define key terms, explore colorism as an individual and structural phenomenon, and identify some predominant themes in the existing scholarship on colorism. We review three case studies of contemporary uses and ramifications of colorism in order to encourage scholars to engage with this important field. These case studies are skin tone’s impact on U.S. politics, “transraciality,” the appropriation of skin tone, and finally, the global skin lightening industry. While the first two are mostly focused on the United States, the third enables an appreciation of the global dynamics of colorism, and links back to the national and regional contextual politics of skin tone.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/23326492211012532

12/10/2023 8:09:18	(8) Post | LinkedIn	Recently, a colleague's daughter posed a question to her mother: "Why do black women frequently change jobs?" In an effort to provide a comprehensive response and dispel any misconceptions, I have written this post to shed light on the factors that may contribute to job mobility among black women  Black women face unique challenges in the corporate world, often encountering discrimination and bias that hinder their career progression. Research has consistently shown that they encounter barriers such as lack of mentorship and biased performance evaluations, which negatively impact their upward mobility within organisations. The intersectionality of race and gender compounds these struggles, resulting in higher rates of job turnover for black women.  In the UK, black women face significant obstacles in career advancement and essential support compared to their male and white colleagues. A study conducted by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey reveals that black women are less likely to be promoted or receive crucial support within corporate America, and while specific data may vary within the UK context, similar disparities exist.	https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthony-lane-peltier_many-black-women-have-to-move-out-to-move-activity-7135390330605961216-TnMF/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android
12/10/2023 8:10:19	Lily Zheng	After the summer of 2020, DEI job postings surged by 123% percent—but these same roles were disproportionately affected in layoffs, on top of having extraordinarily high turnover rates. The average tenure for a Chief Diversity Officer is now only one-third of other executives', 21 months. Flimsy leadership support and siloization means that for most organizations, these roles are ineffective at best, reputational garnish that's the first to go at the first sign of economic pressure.   One of the more enduring changes that has persisted is much less visible: the expansion of DEI councils, committees, and affinity groups since 2020. 90% of Fortune 500 companies have ERGs. Across many of the organizations I've worked with, volunteer DEI groups are becoming the norm even in small and medium-sized organizations. Collectively, these groups often play some of the largest roles in sustaining organizational momentum on DEI. 	https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lilyzheng308_diversity-equity-inclusion-activity-7133156599384219648-c3UL/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android

12/10/2023 8:11:32	Leadership selection: Can changing the default break the glass ceiling? - ScienceDirect	Leadership selection often requires candidates to actively choose to express their interest. Using a series of incentivized experiments with more than 1000 participants, we compare such an Opt-in mechanism with an Opt-out mechanism where everyone qualified for the position is in the candidate pool by default, but individuals can choose to opt out of the selection process. The results reveal a gender gap in participation decisions under the Opt-in mechanism. The gender gap exists even when individuals know they are the top performers, suggesting helping women improve their performance may not necessarily reduce gender gaps. Importantly, women are more likely to participate under the Opt-out mechanism and gender gaps in leadership selection are reduced.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1048984321000680?via%3Dihub

Online hate – especially when it targets women, and Black women in particular – has been extensively documented. So I have a pretty good idea of what to expect if I choose to speak out about sexism and racism in a country unwilling to acknowledge its misdeeds. Anonymous abuse and attacks from political or public figures come with the territory, and I have little choice but to face them.  But I could never have imagined that a French celebrity could subject me to persistent criticism in plain sight, yet escape being called out for it by any of the media figures who invite him to appear on their shows and platforms. It has been a chilling lesson to realise that instead it was me who would end up victimised and put on trial for attempting to expose what I felt was harassment.	https://amp-theguardian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/29/france-black-woman-law-online-criminal

It argues that assessment of “achievement relative to opportunity” is essential to the equitable positioning of women in the academy.  Methodology/approach This qualitative study is based on extended structured interviews with 43 staff.  Findings Men and women can experience career interruptions, deviations, and hijacks, but, in general, women experience more interruption, and the cumulative effect on their careers is greater.  Practical implications The authors point to ways in which the assessment of achievement relative to opportunity can be implemented in universities to improve retention and career outcomes for female academic and professional staff.	https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S1529-212620140000019004/full/html

Achievement Relative to Opportunity acknowledges diverse career histories, a range of personal and professional circumstances and working arrangements. It is not about providing special consideration, diluting merit or lessening standards of performance.

Later in 2016, this term would surface again reopening a centuries old conversation around hair, when Beyonce so eloquently vocalized in her 2016 album, Lemonade, “You better call Becky with the Good Hair.” Well, who is Becky with the good hair? Becky is a white woman with soft, long, sleek hair that is viewed as more “desirable.” Becky with the good hair contributes to the struggle that many Black women face: the damaging effects of colorism that places Eurocentric features on a pedestal.	https://ggusocialjusticelj.org/2023/04/24/dont-touch-my-hair/

Further, our research has found that 70 percent of all suspension disciplines are discretionary. Specifically, Black students are more likely to be suspended for discretionary reasons such as dress code or long hair violations, neither of which have been found to be predictive of student misconduct.  Discretionary suspensions are not ‘required’ by law, yet they pose dire consequences to students of color. They place students on a trajectory towards poor academic performance, leading to higher rates of dropping out of school, joining gangs, and getting arrested before the age of 21.	https://www.brookings.edu/articles/penalizing-black-hair-in-the-name-of-academic-success-is-undeniably-racist-unfounded-and-against-the-law/

I remember how anxious I felt as my cousin pressed down hard on my roots, knowing full well that one tiny slip of her hand could lead to a permanent burn mark on my face, ear or neck.  In high school, I began using chemical products that guaranteed to relax my roots and give me the flowing, shiny hair that rivaled the white women I saw in glamorous shampoo ads. But when I started college, I faced a whole new set of pressures: I joined black student organizations where chemically processed hair was seen as a throwback to the era of white suppression. In order to be a card-carrying progressive, you had to embrace your natural hair.  I know my story isn’t all that unique. A February 2017 study found that black women feel more anxiety about their hair and are twice as likely in comparison to white women to feel pressure to straighten it in their workplace. And the study found that many people “show implicit bias against black women’s textured hair.”	https://time.com/4909898/black-hair-discrimination-ignorance/

I’m trying to end this discrimination | Emma Dabiri | The Guardian	This is reminiscent of my own experiences in school where I was one of the very few black children. I remember a detention in my first year of secondary school at age 12 (we start secondary school a year older in Ireland). All of the other girls were 17- and 18-year-olds who proclaimed shock at my inclusion in their cohort. “You’re too little to be on detention!” they said. My crime? The sheer devilry of wearing the wrong colour scrunchy. The offending scrunchy was a woefully inadequate measure, one which I had used out of desperation to try and tie back a texture of hair not designed to be tied back, hair that I was made to feel deeply embarrassed by and which needed products and expertise not easily found in the Ireland of the late 1980s and early 90s.

News media outlets have recently highlighted the ways schools create and sustain racially biased policies and schooling environments, demonstrating the media’s role in promoting awareness of schools’ mistreatment of Black children. This study examines media reports that shed light on these dynamics, focusing on urban/metropolitan areas in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and Massachusetts. We ask: What do news media accounts—explicitly and implicitly—reveal about Black children and their families' experiences with hair policies in K-12 schools? We take up critical race discourse analysis to examine selected news media accounts of four recent, high profile (i.e., viral) events of Black students’ experiences with hair policies in K-12 U.S. schools. Analysis of our data revealed that Black students face undue discrimination due to schools’ hair policies, and that they and their families reject antiBlack constructions of Black hair care practices and styles.	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11256-023-00674-5

Smith, 2022	Similar to other aspects of life, White cultural norms influence the evaluations and expectations placed on Black women in the workplace. Even though Bo Derek inspired many White women to wear braids after her character in the film 10, the New York District Court sided with American Airlines when Renee Rogers sued her employer for denying her the right to wear similar braids to work. Nearly 40 years later, laws in California and New York City have finally acknowledged this approach as racial discrimination by making it illegal for any public and private entity from discriminating against Black hair. Building off these competing legal interpretations, this article analyzes the discrimination targeted at Black women’s hairstyles, the directions provided by both the New York City Human Rights Law and the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act, and the relevance that this issue has for Black women across the nation.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2153368719888264

A wave of recent media and news coverage tells the stories of Black students who have been teased by peers, disciplined, and even excluded from school because of their hairstyles. These trends underscore the enduring anti-Black racism in schools and sociopolitical significance of Black hair in America. From a developmental perspective, such trends raise questions about the role of Black hair in the development of racial identity, especially among Black adolescent girls. The current paper follows a critical qualitative analysis to examine whether, when, and how Black adolescent girls (N = 60, Mage = 16.17 years) reference hair when discussing their racial and gender identities. Results show that 93% of Black girls spontaneously mention hair in their interviews. Girls’ references to hair highlighted the realities of oppression (i.e., discrimination) they encounter at the intersection of race and gender as well as the way girls used hair to illustrate their resistance to white feminine beauty standards and anti-Black racism. We discuss the contributions of critical qualitative analysis for identity theory and Black girls’ development.

"We've all heard of Red-S - being females losing their periods. You're not going to be able to fall pregnant if you haven't got a period.  "It's actually a really unhealthy lifestyle that these females can't have kids and it's actually really sad.  "I've always consistently had a period but the amount of conversations I've heard of people having Red-S.  "Red-S is actually really dangerous... these people are giving up lots of things that really deep down they want."  Kenny had her first child in 2017 and gave birth to her second child six months ago - but had a miscarriage and then an ectopic pregnancy in between.  What is Red-S? It is a condition of low energy availability which has a serious impact on long-term health and performance.  It can impact oestrogen levels leading to missed periods.  Of the UK athletes surveyed, 36% have knowingly ignored missed periods in the belief that this is normal for an active person, according to the Female Athlete Health Report 2023 from Project Red-S and Kyniska Advocacy who surveyed 769 people.	https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/67690168

But when her supportive female program director left, everything changed. Suddenly, Daywalker could do no right. She was told she wasn’t closing clinic notes fast enough, even though she thought she closed them as quickly as other residents. She was told to be on campus all day even though other residents often worked from home. Her previously excellent performance reviews dropped in every area.

The exclusion and limited recruitment, retention and success of some racial and ethnic groups and other minoritized communities in the geosciences is often discussed using the metaphor of a leaky pipeline. However, as many have argued, this passive imagery betrays the fact that, in many ways, the experience for minoritized scholars is more like a vicious or hostile obstacle course5,6,7,8,9,10 with barriers that have been put in place to slow down or exclude certain groups. 	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00868-0
12/19/2023 6:30:40	How Tone Policing Is Used to Silence Black Women	Tone policing can be used against anyone. It is frequently used against marginalized people, in part due to unconscious bias. Consider this example: Chris believes that Fran doesn’t have a right to tell Chris what to do because of Fran’s race or gender. For this reason, Chris may try to shift the conversation any time Fran is telling Chris what to do, such as by saying “You seem really angry” instead of talking about the specific issue.  According to writer Tess Martin, tone policing is a tactic of oppression that works to shut down discussions about difficult topics, such as racism.  It is often used to silence Black women, and may include stereotypes of Black women as being angry or aggressive. These stereotypes are based in racism, and were used — along with other notions — to justify slavery. 	https://www.blackburncenter.org/post/how-tone-policing-is-used-to-silence-black-women

With today’s increased focus on diversity and inclusion, executives, chief diversity officers and human resources leaders love to extol the value of bringing our authentic selves to the workplace, but for many Black women in corporate America that platitude falls on deaf ears. Black women have long ago learned that we’re not afforded full access to our humanity as we’re not afforded full access to our emotions. Instead, the tacit workplace message we’ve been sent for decades is “Please show up in a way that makes White people feel most comfortable…and if you’d do something with your hair, we’d appreciate that too.” As Black women face a range of challenges in a corporate America that has traditionally been unsupportive if not downright toxic for the Black female spirit, one ongoing burden has been the daily struggle of avoiding “the angry Black woman” label.	https://www.forbes.com/sites/danabrownlee/2021/11/23/dear-corporate-america-stop-tone-policing-black-women-we-have-every-right-to-be-angry/?sh=5e8180e29b0e

But, in the wake of George Floyd's death last May and the summer's Black Lives Matter protests, tone policing in a racial context took center stage. Protests in cities across the U.S. were tainted by mainstream media's depctions of acts such as vandalism and arson as widespread.  People, especially BIPOC women, encounter tone policing everywhere from the office to online encounters on social media to the workplace. No women saw this more than the three founders of Black Lives Matter, whose tone, approach to protest and even the name of their movement were questioned by everyone from the far right to Martin Luther King III, son of the slain civil rights leader.	https://laist.com/news/racism-101-lets-talk-about-tone-policing

Now, research published by the American Psychological Association finds that disparity may exist even in subtle differences in officers’ tone of voice when they address Black and White drivers during routine traffic stops.  In the study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology®, researchers gathered short audio excerpts from police body camera footage and found that when officers spoke to Black men at traffic stops, their tone of voice conveyed less warmth, respect and ease than when they spoke to White men. The researchers also found that these subtle negative interactions can contribute to a cycle of mistrust between police and the Black community. 	https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/07/officers-tone-racial-disparities

12/21/2023 10:30:26	Full article: Reading internationally: if citing is a political practice, who are we reading and who are we citing?	Across multiple disciplines from communication science and political science to astronomy, research has pointed to gender citation bias, racialised citation bias and the regional tilt of many international journals towards authors based in a small set of countries, including the USA, the UK and Australia (e.g., Caplar, Tacchella, and Birrer Citation2017; Dion, Sumner, and Mitchell Citation2018; Trepte and Loths Citation2020). These citation patterns not only have an effect on the quality of research publications and the breadth of perspectives and insights circulating as contributions to knowledge but also on the futures of individual scholars working in systems in which citation scores matter for careers. Citing is political. We recognize these biases in articles in Learning, Media and Technology, and encourage contributors to consider whether their manuscripts reflect the diversity of research perspectives in the field or if their research and writing would benefit from incorporating a broader range of research.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439884.2022.2140673

The use of citation frequency and impact factor as measures of research quality and journal prestige is being criticized. Citation frequency is augmented by self-citation and for most journals the majority of citations originate from a minority of papers. We hypothesized that citation frequency is also associated with the geographical origin of the research publication. Objective. We determined whether citations originate more frequently from institutes that are located in the same country as the authors of the cited publication than would be expected by chance. Design. We screened citations referring to 1200 cardiovascular publications in the 7 years following their publication. For the 1200 citation recipient publications we documented the country where the research originated (9 countries/regions) and the total number of received citations. For a selection of 8864 citation donor papers we registered the country/region where the citing paper originated. Results. Self-citation was common in cardiovascular journals (n = 1534, 17.8%). After exclusion of self-citation, however, the number of citations that originated from the same country as the author of the citation recipient was found to be on average 31.6% higher than would be expected by chance (p<0.01 for all countries/regions). In absolute numbers, nation oriented citation bias was most pronounced in the USA, the country with the largest research output (p<0.001). Conclusion. Citation frequency was significantly augmented by nation oriented citation bias. This nation oriented citation behaviour seems to mainly influence the cumulative citation number for papers originating from the countries with a larger research output.	https://akjournals.com/view/journals/11192/70/1/article-p153.xml

Articles published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet were used to study citation practices of U.S. and U.K. authors. Percentages of cited references to material published in a specific country were calculated for both the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet. Using a variation of a citation publication ratio based on Frame and Narin's original ratio, an attempt was made to quantify author bias. To calculate these ratios, values from SERLINE* and the British Library Lending Division were employed to find world journal counts. The results suggest that U.S. authors publishing in the New England Journal of Medicine and U.K. authors publishing in Lancet tend to cite material produced in their own countries more than would be warranted by the amount of material produced by these countries. In addition, these authors cited material produced in non-U.S. and non-U.K. countries far less than the amount of material produced by these countries would indicate.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC225441/

This was confirmed in a 2016 survey conducted by Lex Bouter. People attending international research integrity conferences ranked selective citation to enhance one’s own findings or convictions, or to please editors, reviewers or colleagues, as the most frequently occurring form of research misbehaviour.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01410768221075881

Citation rates may be influenced by journal accessibility, perceived journal ‘prestige’ (impact factor) or national bias. Authors, editors and reviewers should be aware of this potential bias in citation habits. Authors should strive to conduct exhaustive searches using electronic methods, so that all relevant papers are assessed, regardless of their origin.	https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.00267.x?casa_token=4qDuUcMAVgkAAAAA:dHm8PMpCVvwCj6agb8riLbh_zSpvsh2LWXl7Gekbvjivfrcga_RtFT7_HfqhRxrROEsxsK57oVJjLA

We reveal the existence of a ‘transatlantic’ rift in citation practice and of a confined discipline-oriented world which interfaces weakly with many other disciplines. We also interpret the results of our analyses in terms of basic and clinical research and examine whether there is a time-related selectivity in citation. Taken together, our results call for a serious appraisal of present-day research trends and of their evaluation. The open question is how to create a terrain that will foster original, possibly interdisciplinary, research in developed nations whilst maintaining cultural individuality.	https://akjournals.com/view/journals/11192/45/1/article-p81.xml

At the same time, they may also have personal preferences that impact their objectivity. This paper examines these issues in the context of peer review at the US National Institutes of Health. I show that evaluators are both better informed and more biased about the quality of projects in their own area. On net, the benefits of expertise weakly dominate the costs of bias. As such, policies designed to limit bias by seeking impartial evaluators may reduce the quality of funding decisions.	https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20150421
12/21/2023 10:44:01	Quantifying and suppressing ranking bias in a large citation network - ScienceDirect	It is widely recognized that citation counts for papers from different fields cannot be directly compared because different scientific fields adopt different citation practices. Citation counts are also strongly biased by paper age since older papers had more time to attract citations. Various procedures aim at suppressing these biases and give rise to new normalized indicators, such as the relative citation count. We use a large citation dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph and a new statistical framework based on the Mahalanobis distance to show that the rankings by well known indicators, including the relative citation count and Google's PageRank score, are significantly biased by paper field and age. Our statistical framework to assess ranking bias allows us to exactly quantify the contributions of each individual field to the overall bias of a given ranking. We propose a general normalization procedure motivated by the z-score which produces much less biased rankings when applied to citation count and PageRank score.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751157717300974

Kramer, Steph Lambert, 2001	The literature addressing gender-based discrimination in promotion decisions has primarily focused on case studies of Fortune 500 companies or scenarios in which managers are asked to make simulated promotion decisions. Such studies are limited in both scope and generalizability. This research attempts to overcome these limitations by examining a large, random sample of female and male workers. Using survival analysis, we explore the period of time from the year of hire to the year promotion to supervisor is achieved. Avoiding bias that may be associated with analyses pertaining to a particular type of organization or sector of the economy, this investigation focuses on a particular career moment—procession to a primary rung of the career ladder. Findings support the existence of significant pro-male bias in promotion decisions unattributable to differences in time on the job, education, or parenting responsibilities.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1525/sop.2001.44.1.111

Starck, Travis Riddle, Stacey Sinclair, Natasha Warikoo, 2020	Schools are heralded by some as unique sites for promoting racial equity. Central to this characterization is the presumption that teachers embrace racial equity and teaching about this topic. In contrast, others have documented the ongoing role of teachers in perpetuating racial inequality in schools. In this article, we employ data from two national data sets to investigate teachers’ explicit and implicit racial bias, comparing them to adults with similar characteristics. We find that both teachers and nonteachers hold pro-White explicit and implicit racial biases. Furthermore, differences between teachers and nonteachers were negligible or insignificant. The findings suggest that if schools are to effectively promote racial equity, teachers should be provided with training to either shift or mitigate the effects of their own racial biases.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0013189X20912758

Lewis, 2020	Organizations invest nearly $8 billion annually in diversity training, but questions have arisen about whether training actually reduces biased attitudes, changes behavior, and increases diversity. In this article, we review the relevant evidence, noting that training should be explicitly aimed at increasing awareness of and concern about bias while at the same time providing strategies that attendees can use to change their behavior. After outlining five challenges to developing and delivering training that meets these goals, we provide evidence-based recommendations that organizations and facilitators can use as a blueprint for creating anti-bias training programs that work. One recommendation is to couple investment in anti-bias training with other diversity and inclusion initiatives to help ensure that the billions spent each year yield meaningful change.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/237946152000600106
12/22/2023 7:31:06	Does Gender Bias Still Affect Women in Science? | Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews	The percentage of women employed in professional scientific positions has been low but is increasing over time. The U.S. National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have both implemented programs to improve women’s participation in science, and many universities and companies have diversity and equity programs. While most faculty and scientists believe that they are fair and unbiased, numerous well-designed studies published in leading peer-reviewed journals show that gender bias in sciences and medicine is widespread and persistent today in both faculty and students. Recent studies show that gender bias affects student grading, professional hiring, mentoring, tenure, promotion, respect, grant proposal success, and pay. In addition, sexual harassment remains a significant barrier. Fortunately, several studies provide evidence that programs that raise conscious awareness of gender bias can improve equity in science, and there are a number of recommendations and strategies for improving the participation of women.	https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mmbr.00018-19

Past research is limited by relying on explicit questionnaire ratings in mock-hiring scenarios, thereby ignoring the potential role of implicit gender bias in the real world. We examine the interactive effect of explicit and implicit gender biases on promotion decisions made by scientific evaluation committees representing the whole scientific spectrum in the course of an annual nationwide competition for elite research positions. Findings reveal that committees with strong implicit gender biases promoted fewer women at year 2 (when committees were not reminded of the study) relative to year 1 (when the study was announced) if those committees did not explicitly believe that external barriers hold women back. When committees believed that women face external barriers, implicit biases did not predict selecting more men over women. This finding highlights the importance of educating evaluative committees about gender biases.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0686-3

Unfortunately, this diversity is not always represented by the demographic characteristics of healthcare professionals themselves. Patients from underrepresented groups in the United States can experience the effects of unintentional cognitive (unconscious) biases that derive from cultural stereotypes in ways that perpetuate health inequities. Unconscious bias can also affect healthcare professionals in many ways, including patient-clinician interactions, hiring and promotion, and their own interprofessional interactions. The strategies described in this article can help us recognize and mitigate unconscious bias and can help create an equitable environment in healthcare, including the field of infectious diseases.	https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/220/Supplement_2/S62/5552356

More than four in 10 (44%) of black women do not believe they are offered the same career advancement opportunities as their non-black female colleagues, the network found, while more than two thirds (68%) have experienced racial bias at work.  Black women in senior executive or senior management positions were even less likely to believe they were offered the same professional development opportunities, with 33% and 31% respectively thinking this to be the case.  Half of those in senior management positions had resigned due to racially unfair or uncivil treatment from colleagues, and a third of all respondents had resigned for this reason. Thirty-eight percent suspected they did not earn as much as non-black colleagues performing the same role.	https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/black-female-managers-overlooked-for-promotion/

According to the Women in The Workplace 2018 survey, women of color are not only significantly underrepresented, they are far less likely than others to be promoted to manager, more likely to face everyday discrimination and less likely to receive support from their managers.  The researchers surveyed 279 companies employing more than 13 million people and talked to 64,000 employees on their workplace experiences. More than 90 percent of the companies polled said prioritizing gender and racial diversity leads to better business results. Yet only 42 percent of employees surveyed said they see gender diversity as a company priority and only 22 percent see racial diversity as a company priority.	https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/report-black-women-less-likely-to-be-promoted-supported-by-their-managers

Chance, 2022	This article explores adversity and the lived experiences of Black women in higher education leadership. Using phenomenology, this study specifically explores how Black women in higher education leadership navigate the adverse challenges of intersectionality, stereotype threat, and tokenism. Black women in leadership undergo adversity including limited role models, the concrete ceiling, and the intersectionality of racism, sexism, and ageism, as well as tokenism. The current findings validate that Black women in higher education leadership experience adversity. Some of the more salient codes that emerged were discrimination such as racism, sexism, ageism, and the intersection of these challenges with identity, cultural diversity and belonging, resilience, and leadership callings. Referred to as “superwomen,” Black women are resilient and strong. The results of this study reveal that Black women use adversity as fuel, thus helping them develop the necessary skills to prepare them for leadership. Their strength through adversity is driven by the resilience that has manifested as motivation factors such as family and relationships, mentorship and sponsorship, as well as the support of cultural identity and diversity. The current findings support the notion that adversity shapes Black women into leaders with an emphasis on higher education leadership.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00221678211003000

However, the mechanisms by which discrimination leads to obesity remain unclear. Utilizing multi-omics analyses of neuroimaging and fecal metabolites, we investigated the impact of discrimination exposure on brain reactivity to food images and associated dysregulations in the brain–gut–microbiome system. We show that discrimination is associated with increased food-cue reactivity in frontal-striatal regions involved in reward, motivation and executive control; altered glutamate-pathway metabolites involved in oxidative stress and inflammation as well as preference for unhealthy foods. Associations between discrimination-related brain and gut signatures were skewed towards unhealthy sweet foods after adjusting for age, diet, body mass index, race and socioeconomic status. Discrimination, as a stressor, may contribute to enhanced food-cue reactivity and brain–gut–microbiome disruptions that can promote unhealthy eating behaviors, leading to increased risk for obesity. Treatments that normalize these alterations may benefit individuals who experience discrimination-related stress.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00134-9#:~:text=Discrimination%20exposure%20is%20associated%20with,with%20oxidative%20stress%20and%20inflammation

She had been dead for 10 years.  The woman was called Bep de Bruin. Born in what was the Dutch East Indies, she moved to the Netherlands as a teenager.

They were the last among thousands ousted from host city Seoul after losing years-long, pre-Olympic battles against officials, police, construction workers and hired thugs. A massive effort to beautify the capital had razed hundreds of poor neighborhoods to make way for new high-rise buildings.

After mega Typhoon Hagibis lashed eastern Japan in October last year, a homeless man being denied shelter at a local evacuation center sparked international outrage. As the Olympics captures the world’s attention, the Japanese government’s approach to alleviating homelessness is being carefully watched.  While official surveys suggest homelessness is decreasing, private surveys reveal the opposite.

Brazil is not the first Olympic host country where the treatment of people on the streets in advance of the games has raised concerns. In a 2011 paper for Sociology, Jacqueline Kennelly and Paul Watt looked at Vancouver around the time of the 2010 Winter Olympics and London as it geared up for the 2012 Summer Games. They held focus groups and one-on-one interviews with homeless and at-risk young people.  In the year leading up to the 2010 games, the Vancouver young people told the researchers, police established a “red zone” in a wealthier part of town where Olympic events were to be held. Particular people who had been warned about their behavior were kept out.	https://daily.jstor.org/how-olympics-host-citie-hide-their-homeless/

The news agency Agence France-Presse reported that since mid-March, the government has asked local prefects to create temporary reception centres in every French region except the north and Corsica, which would free up space in hotels normally used as emergency accommodation centres in and around Paris.  The housing minister, Olivier Klein, told parliament this month that numerous hotels did not want to serve as emergency accommodation for homeless people or asylum seekers this autumn because they expected an influx of visitors during the rugby World Cup, and the same was true for next summer’s Olympics. Maud Gatel, a centrist MP from the MoDem party, said 5,000 beds in emergency accommodation would be lost.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/24/anger-over-plan-to-persuade-homeless-people-to-leave-paris-before-olympics-asylum-seekers-temporary-reception-centres

The expansion of the stadium led to the expulsion of dozens of homeless people who lived in and around the park surrounding the stadium, and a sudden decision to demolish a nearby public housing estate built for the 1964 Summer Games forced over 200 tenants, most of whom were elderly, to be relocated. While the homeless people engaged in several rounds of negotiation with the government authorities, the majority of the housing tenants reluctantly agreed to move except for a few who kept demanding respectful treatment from the metropolitan government. Presenting the preliminary results of a mixed-method three-year qualitative study, this research note demonstrates that while the authority might have offered alternative housing considered ‘adequate’ in terms of physical living conditions, the process of evictions did not afford autonomy for the affected to choose where to live. The respective status of the affected – homeless and elderly – may demand the reconsideration of the concept of ‘adequate housing’ in relation to human dignity.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02614367.2017.1355408

The aim of the paper is to analyze the initial, historical, journey of this World Cup from its conceptual formation until the end of its first decade (2003–2012). The paper looks particularly at the efforts involved in bringing the concept to life and the challenges the organizers faced before achieving the annual frequency of an event dedicated for wider social purposes. However, also discussed is the use of competitive football formats and the organization of the competition for male and female players. As the tournament has become more successful, it is argued that its overall aim of proposing tools beyond sport for homeless people has been displaced in certain ways. The management orientations, the focus on the trophies, images of excitement, and the corporate agendas have brought sensitive contradictions to its principles of inclusion.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09523367.2019.1593148

The Huffington Post reported the story of a family who were given no notice or warnings of any kind before several men turned up at their door and proceeded to reduce their home to rubble and ash. The Global Post reports that upwards of 15,000 families have been removed from Rio de Janeiro as well.  However, according to many reports, the potential overall economic impact of the World Cup in Brazil will be about $24 billion, according to Bloomberg, while Forbes reports that Brazil’s Ministry of Sports calculates that Brazil’s economy will receive a $70 billion injection from the games. The International Business Times points out, however, that there can sometimes be a “World Cup effect” on countries where there is a promise of a large injection of capital to boost the country’s economy as a result of the games being hosted there, but in the end, it falls short.  South Africa is a prime example of this “World Cup effect.” South Africa invested nearly $5 billion in various renovations and restorations of buildings and has only made 11 percent of it back as of 2010.

Sport is seen as gendered, exemplifying hegemonic masculinity and associated violence, with the link between sporting culture and violence against women well recognised. This paper reports on a systematic review of empirical research literature exploring the link between major sporting events and incidence of DV. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Proquest Central databases from inception to December 2020 for quantitative studies examining major sports events and reports of DV using a pre–post comparison design.  Results are presented qualitatively due to the heterogeneity across studies. Most studies originated in North America and the United Kingdom, used police records as their data source for measuring incidences of DV and few looked beyond the day of the sports event for recorded incidences of DV. Studies reviewed suggested that there is an association between certain major sports events and increased reporting of DV. 	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/hsc.14028

A study in 2014 by academics at Lancaster University looked at the number of reports of abuse to a police force in the north-west of England during three football World Cups. They found that such reports increased by 26% when the national team won or drew, and by 38% when the team lost (other studies suggest abuse is worse when England wins). A new study, published on July 4th, goes much further. Ria Ivandic, Tom Kirchmaier and Neus Torres-Blas of the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) have analysed 523,546 domestic-abuse incidents reported to the Greater Manchester Police between 2012 and 2019, alongside detailed information on 780 games played by Manchester City and Manchester United in that period. They have been able to disentangle why intimate partner violence increases after games and to create a timeline of when women are most at risk.

While the focus has been on “player violence” and “crowd violence” it is recognised that a variety of other incidents of sports-related violence exist, including domestic violence. Empirical and anecdotal evidence point toward increased rates of domestic violence among male athletes. Moreover, there is evidence that domestic violence also increases around sporting events in wider society; however, the evidence is at times contradictory. It is not argued that sport causes domestic violence, but that it can provide the conditions that enable forms of domestic violence. It is acknowledged that the evidence is at most correlational, and that further work is needed to understand this complex association. In particular, the “holy trinity” of sports, alcohol, and hegemonic masculinity is offered to explain this association. The wide appeal of sport can, however, be exploited to engage with males and support them in confronting the issues that underpin domestic violence, in conjunction with female empowerment and the pursuit of gender equality.	https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/6808

The men’s football World Cup is currently taking place in Qatar. Even people who are not regular football fans are drawn into nationalistic displays of passion while glued to TV screens at home or in bars or fanatically checking the sports news. The 2018 World Cup saw over half the world’s population tuning in.  But there is a dark side to such an event. Research shows that major sporting events are linked to increased reports of domestic violence.1 In the last World Cup, cases of domestic violence involving alcohol saw a 47% rise on days when England won and an 18% increase on days after an England match.2 When these sporting events occur, the police, health services, and specialist services will likely see more calls and hospital admissions related to domestic violence.  Domestic violence, also known as intimate partner violence, refers to physical, sexual, or psychological harm inflicted by a partner or former partner. It is a global epidemic, with almost one third (27%) of women aged over 15 years reporting that they have been subjected to violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime.3 Such violence substantially affects the physical and mental health and wellbeing of women and children throughout their lives.4 Women can experience depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes, and chronic pain,5 whereas children can experience aggression, mood disorders, and disrupted development.67 More than half (56%) of women murdered worldwide last year were killed by intimate partners or other relatives.8 Men can also be affected by domestic violence, but rates are much higher for male perpetration of violence against women,8 particularly during major sporting events.	https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj.o3021

Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, made $29m (£23.4m) in 2022 – 362 times the median GM worker pay. The same year, Stellantis's CEO Carlos Tavares made $24.8m (£20m), or 365 times the average worker pay; and Ford's CEO Jim Farley made $21m (£17m), or 281 times the median worker pay.  CEO pay in the US has grown 1,322% since 1978, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Such astronomical CEO pay is a very American problem.

We’ve always had to use platforms that, quite frankly, do not care about us as people.   And I can acknowledge all of the problems the fedi has, many of which are being replicated by people that admire the bigots that run centralized platforms.   But I’m not still here because of what the fedi is, but rather what it could be. The fedi represents an opportunity to bend social media technology to conform to our ethics, values, and politics. As flawed as it is, it provides a chance that has not existed at this scale.   The process is arduous, ugly, and often thankless, but every inch we get closer to figuring all this stuff out is a victory that should be celebrated. Because what we’re doing is fucking hard.  I’m not ceding this ground because bands of roaming bigots cannot see beyond their hate.

These include the concerns of people with albinism who have found themselves the targets of attackers who kill and mutilate them to remove their body parts in the false belief they will bring luck and wealth. They include the women with disabilities in West Africa who have been accused of witchcraft and alienated from their communities – or worse.

These experts are trying to fix that - ABC News	About a quarter of the Australian population is estimated to have non-European or an Indigenous background. Yet, according to the Australian Human Rights Commission, such backgrounds only account for 5 per cent of senior leadership positions.  "If we're holding a mirror up to ourselves, we're simply not seeing who we are in our positions of leadership in major institutions," Tim Soutphommasane, the former race discrimination commissioner, says.	https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-02/improving-diversity-in-leadership-roles/101065700

The inspection and interrogation that leaders face is even more severe for Black women leaders, especially those who are the “firsts.” This was evidenced during the confirmation hearings of the first Black female U.S. Supreme Court justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. As author Mikki Kendall wrote in a Time piece in 2022, “Despite her impressive credentials, Jackson has faced an onslaught of microaggressions, outright falsehoods, and demands for irrelevant information.” Jackson displayed an admirable level of coolness and composure despite the barrage of ridiculous claims and criticism from Senators.	https://www-forbes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2024/01/02/claudine-gay-resigns-from-harvard-why-black-excellence-is-never-enough/amp/

These changes have been uneven, with growth in underrepresented students exceeding that of faculty diversity. To address these and other inequities, a growing number of universities have established an executive-level chief diversity officer (CDO). Our study offers a first empirical examination of this effort at selected 4-year U.S. universities from 2001 to 2019 using unique data on the initial hiring date of a CDO and publicly available demographic data. We provide a comprehensive overview of demographic trends within our data and find confidence intervals around the estimated instantaneous average treatment effect for an executive-level CDO on diverse hiring tightly contain zero. Estimated treatment effects are small and lack statistical significance within 4 years of a CDO position being established. We discuss other possible factors that explain trends toward higher diversity on campus and several possible constraints.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/soej.12584

Left unanswered, such research can bloom into disinformation that undermines tribal sovereignty. Lumbee people, who are Indigenous to the southeastern United States, have been subjects of extractive research for more than a century. Extractive researchers have subjected Lumbee people to pseudoscientific methods of inquiry and arms-length guesswork, and they have failed to acknowledge expertise held within the Lumbee community about their own origins and collective identity. Here we consider the long history of extractive research conducted on our people, including the implications of this work for the full recognition of Lumbee people as a sovereign Indigenous nation. We share personal stories that converge around a recent example of extractive research that typifies the long pattern of "talking over" Lumbees and other Indigenous peoples.	https://muse.jhu.edu/article/871551

Instead, it often serves the income generation interests of academics, higher education institutions, and a lucrative knowledge-exchange industry, which prioritises the perspectives of public and private corporations, politicians, inter-governmental departments and agencies, and a growing NGO sector.	https://systemicjustice.ngo/2023/10/a-reflection-on-extractive-research/

1/13/2024 19:14:58	The Failure of the DEI-Industrial Complex	There’s a big, poorly kept secret in the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) industry: the actual efficacy of an uncomfortably large proportion of our “flagship” services, talking points, and interventions — unconscious bias training, racial sensitivity workshops, the “business case for diversity,” resume anonymization, and the like — is lower than many practitioners make it out to be.  Unconscious bias training rarely changes actual behaviors and has little impact on explicit biases. A meta-analysis of hundreds of prejudice-reduction interventions found few that unambiguously achieved their goals. Many popular interventions run the risk of backlash, strong adverse reactions that sustain or even worsen the inequity that practitioners attempt to eliminate. Even “the business case for diversity,” a decades-old rhetorical framing and justification for DEI work, has been found to backfire on marginalized groups’ feelings of belonging and weaken support for diversity programs when organizational performance drops.	https://hbr.org/2022/12/the-failure-of-the-dei-industrial-complex

Their lip service means they are fine staying at the homogeneous basecamp rather than risking the ascent to the higher elevation of equity in their own organizations. McCambridge noted that many larger organizations in both the private and nonprofit sectors have diversity officers, yet these positions tend to serve largely as window dressing for pseudo-change. They provide cover for companies to say they are addressing diversity and inclusion issues. However, without providing funding or formal authority to enact changes, these diversity officers are often left essentially powerless.	https://nonprofitquarterly.org/why-are-we-still-struggling-with-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-nonprofit-governance/

Go to the bottom of almost any job description on any website of any well-meaning social sector organization and you will see it: some sort of statement about diversity and how “everyone is welcome.”  However, just like diet pills that claim you’ll lose weight in your sleep in 10 days and keep it off, the statements don’t ring true. Still, they persist.  There is this idea that has taken root in the sector. If you say you believe in and are committed to diversity and you put a statement on your website, then these two steps make you a diversity champion.  Not true. And it’s also not enough to ask “where are all the professional fundraisers of color” or “why won’t they stay with our organizations” while simultaneously failing to ensure you have set up systems and developed a cultural ethos that values diversity and inclusion.	https://bloomerang.co/blog/why-do-nonprofits-struggle-with-diversity/

These people don't have enough to pay for their stuff and they don't speak a word of English".  I asked how much. $1.13. Their SNAP card was just over a dollar short.  When I used to work as a cashier, I was regularly a few bucks short at the end of the day for this exact reason.  I told them to just go have a good day and that I'd pay for their stuff. It was only $16 in total.  The indifference in society today makes me so sad. They needed food more than Safeway needed a dew more dollars of profit.  When I went to pay, the kiosk offered to have me round up or donate $5 to feed the hungry.  I think direct action made a bigger difference today.  Edit: to make the moral more explicit.

The Six Grandfathers (original name of Mt Rushmore), holds religious significance for Native Americans. 3. The monument was built by Borglum, a white-supremacist sympathizer with connections to the Ku Klux Klan. 4.The monument celebrates the European settlers (two of which were slave owners) who killed so many Native Americans and appropriated their land.	https://medium.com/the-collector/the-racist-history-of-mount-rushmore-56491d881e65

Out of the hundreds I taught no more than a handful impressed me as being more than mediocre or even pretty bad. A large number of them were toxic individuals and many were petty-minded. Only a handful showed true leadership and management skills. The truth is that people get ahead for the wrong reasons. They are selected for being bossy self-promoters or yes-men, though it helps to be tall if you're a man and good-looking if you're a woman. Psychopaths are grossly over-represented in management (a little internet search will give you the evidence for this).

1/19/2024 16:17:35	The future of MAiD has the disability community worried	If you happen to be disabled, these expansions to MAiD not only feel like a threat, but a promise. A promise that the government is coming to kill us and that they’ll make it happen by any means necessary. They will deny us accessible housing so the only option left is MAiD. They will force us to live below the poverty line so the only option left is MAiD. And if we do not give into their coercion, they will make our lives unlivable.  The government will cover the costs of the medications needed for MAiD, but they won’t cover the cost of medications needed to live. They’ll make MAiD available in every health authority but if you need specialized care, you’ll have to commute to a large city like Vancouver. They’ll provide an email that will connect First Nations communities to a MAiD coordination team but won’t address the suicide crisis in these same communities. 	https://the-peak.ca/2022/05/the-future-of-maid-has-the-disability-community-worried/

1/19/2024 16:27:16	The next national apology: Future Canadians might regret expansion of medically assisted dying laws	In these situations, evidence shows that populations marginalized by poverty, loneliness and unresolved life suffering seek MAiD, with twice as many women as men being euthanized for psychiatric disorders. This is the same ratio of women to men who attempt suicide when mentally ill but who, absent the 100 per cent lethal means of MAiD, survive the attempt and do not try again.  Yet, despite lack of evidence that MAiD can responsibly be provided for mental illness, MAiD expansionists blindly forward the same arguments to push broader access to MAiD with fewer safeguards. This benefits the white, wealthy and privileged to have even more autonomy, while sacrificing our most vulnerable, those marginalized by sexism, racism, ageism and ableism, to entirely avoidable premature deaths.	https://theconversation.com/the-next-national-apology-future-canadians-might-regret-expansion-of-medically-assisted-dying-laws-167688

Someone may qualify for MAID if they are simply “too poor to live with dignity,” according to the Canadian government. A recent poll found that, while most Canadians are against the idea, one-third support assisted suicide to eliminate the homeless population.  Over a quarter of participants strongly (11%) or moderately (16%) agreed that poverty alone is a good cause for government assisted suicide. Again, the majority of Canadians do not agree with these measures but it is alarming that a significant portion of the voting population approves of blatant murder. 	https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/ethics/one-third-of-canadians-support-killing-the-homeless-modern-eugenics/

The political pressure that activists have been able to exert comes from years of work and a growing societal acknowledgement, in Peters’s view, that more disabled people are being pushed into assisted suicide because of MAID.   “The pile of these unusual, extreme circumstances is just getting larger and larger," Peters says. "And as large as it’s getting, we know, of course, that it’s really only a fraction of what’s happening out there, because we’re only hearing from the people who manage to get through all the barriers to be heard publicly.” 	https://www.teenvogue.com/story/canada-maid-law-disabled

In an article published by the Associated Press last week, Tim Stainton director of the Canadian Institute for Inclusion and Citizenship at the University of British Columbia said the country’s uniquely permissive euthanasia laws were, “probably the biggest existential threat to disabled people since the Nazis’ program in Germany in the 1930s.”	https://www.forbes.com/sites/gusalexiou/2022/08/15/canadas-new-euthanasia-laws-carry-upsetting-nazi-era-echoes-warns-expert/?sh=19a38f90c7b8

People who can give you detailed accounts of the years of lead, can critique authoritarian marxism with incredible precision, know everyone (white and male) in the scene, and organise skillfully and with great effectiveness...

The selected students, all recruited through the university’s disabilities support services (Hughes was the office director at the time), had documented disabilities that included ADHD, hearing loss, and cerebral palsy, among others. Ages ranged from nineteen to twenty-eight.  Several of the students identified “pejorative stereotypes pervasive in the dominant cultural narrative surrounding individuals with disabilities and African American men.” They explained how the stereotypes shaped their self-images, contributed to feelings of social isolation, and amplified the perceptions of other students that disabled people have limited intellectual abilities. They were reminded of their marginality throughout the day: during peer interactions, because of the refusal of accommodations by faculty, and as a result of the questioning of their competence in the workplace. The negative perceptions repeatedly popped up in social, academic, and professional contexts.	https://daily.jstor.org/being-black-and-disabled-in-university/

This article, based on data from a multi-site case study exploring the experiences of those in UK higher education who are working on the charter marks, looks at how academic staff become involved in this work. Using a narrative analysis based on the conceptual tools of policy enactment, the article sets out a typology of trajectories of academic involvement in charter mark work. This focus on how academic staff become involved in work on charter marks as policy translators is set alongside a chronological account of the development of the charter mark awards in the UK higher education sector. Through locating staff trajectories in their particular context, we are able to ask questions of how work that seeks to address serious and enduring inequalities in academia is currently allocated and implemented, and with what kinds of expertise.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02680939.2021.1891576

We center our research on the exploration of the question of how the gender-agenda is being captured by the neoliberal agenda, drawing on 35 in-depth qualitative interviews with AS champions across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The core aim of the study is to explore how AS has been co-opted and mobilized as a vehicle for contemporary (neoliberal) equality work. We argue that rather than contributing to transformational change, AS serves as an effective tool for institutional reputation gains and (extended) virtue signaling, conceptualized and coined here as “institutional peacocking.” This in turn, functions and is implemented in diverse institutional settings, with primarily institutional benefit, at the cost of AS champions who carry out gender equality work. We contribute empirically and conceptually to theorizations and current understandings of gender equality work in higher education, especially through AS champions' experience and the institutional benefits that present opportunity costs for some individuals, potentially serving to further entrench stereotyped perceptions of who should be doing equality work in universities, and critically, how institutions benefit.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12941

This essay begins with a brief context and outline of the international refugee crisis and Australia’s reaction. Next, consideration is given to how this nation has identified itself historically and how it has behaved in recent times towards refugees. Australia’s values are then discussed in relation to those of Canada, a similar country in many ways. With this context established, this article then turns to examine the specific issue of access to higher education for young people seeking asylum. Implications of this exclusion and what it means for national identity is discussed. Arendt’s theory of bureaucratic indifference is employed to interpret and understand Australia’s behaviour. The main contribution of this article is the connections made between asylum seekers, educational exclusion, higher education, national identity and Arendt’s theory, that may have application in other contexts.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13603116.2017.1350321

We conducted a discourse analysis of the media representations of 12 business leaders engaged in philanthropy in Australia to demonstrate how white practices of normalisation, solipsism and ontological expansiveness underpin the construction of white leaders as speaking for society, mastering all environments and self-sacrificing for the greater good. Our analysis suggests that ‘doing leadership’ is inextricably linked to ‘doing whiteness’, while the invisible presence of whiteness in leadership discourses sustains white power and privilege. By ‘naming’ whiteness and its practices, we aspire to unhinge it from its location as transparent, dominant and ordinary, and begin theorising leadership in ways that are conducive to the goals of racial equality.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1742715014565127

These challenges can be likened to “headwinds” that they must constantly battle against, whilst those belonging to dominant social groups benefit from “tailwind” effects. We critique the framing of the “ideal” academic in the neoliberalised university and argue that it entrenches the marginalisation of academics from minoritised backgrounds. Through a collaborative auto-ethnographic approach, we explore how we push back against “headwinds” in order to resist our marginalisation, in particular detailing how collaborative writing and research function as successful protective strategies within hyper-competitive environments. Whilst this article focusses specifically on the Australian context, the international resonances are apparent from connections we illustrate within the literature, and showcase how developments from a distance frame our local contexts.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09518398.2019.1693068
1/23/2024 20:47:16	Full article: Racism and White privilege: highly skilled immigrant women workers in Australia	Skilled immigrant women represent a source of skills for the Australian economy. However, political and historical choices have formed and reinforced new emergent diasporic spaces in a country which remains marked by the British Empire’s heritage. Drawing on 31 qualitative interviews, this article focuses on the career journeys of skilled immigrant women from the UK, India, China and the Philippines in a White Anglo-dominant society. By marking and de-neutralizing the racialized nature of Australian working spaces, the study examines how racism operates within Australian working spaces. It also addresses how White privilege dominates the Australian job market. By providing empirical data about highly skilled immigrant women’s careers, this article sheds light on how racism and White privilege affected all the skilled immigrant women’s career experiences, as there was prejudice and racism in hiring non-White women. The article, therefore, contributes to extending the literature on skilled immigrant women and racism in Australia.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1722195

Its economy, schooling, health care, infrastructure and social values are regularly put up against those of Western Europe and North America, allowing intelligent comparisons to be drawn. Like is compared with like.  But when it comes to the ethnic composition of its population, these comparisons are distorted by history. The unspoken twist is that, until two generations ago, Australia practised a policy of racial exclusion.  The country’s nation-builders placed a straitjacket on the ethnic character of Australia’s future, reflecting the values of racial hierarchy of the post-Victorian age. This policy persisted into the 1970s and meant Australia remained, for a long time, in Asia but certainly not of Asia.	https://theconversation.com/australia-needs-to-confront-its-history-of-white-privilege-to-provide-a-level-playing-field-for-all-139755

Through use of storytelling, we demonstrate how these trends carry on in present-day tertiary education settings. We also issue to colleagues and management in the tertiary education sector a wero (challenge) to inspect dimensions of white fragility. Our wero challenges colleagues to move beyond their pedagogical comfort zones by learning and incorporating Indigenous knowledges into their teaching beyond surface level. For university management, our wero call on leadership to lead institutional conversations on white privileges and white fragilities, such that academic staff cannot perform a white agility by nimbly dancing around decolonial education initiatives.	https://ajie.atsis.uq.edu.au/ajie/article/view/34
1/24/2024 7:27:05	The "Problem" Woman of Colour in NonProfit Organizations - COCo	Below is an overview of the outlined trajectory in the “Problem” Woman of Colour in the Workplace tool. This narrative begins when a racialized woman is hired into an organization where the leadership and/or staff are predominantly White. She is excited to explore her new position and feels welcomed in her new workplace. This is also known as the honeymoon period. However, soon the hire is experienced as tokenism. Even if she was employed because of her skills and qualifications, the hiring process may be perceived as such by colleagues, community members, etc. Further, how her racial identity is used in the context of her position will impact this perception.  After a period of time in her new position, where weeks, months or even days, the reality of a white dominant space becomes apparent. The racialized woman experiences recurring microaggressions and structural barriers. For example:  heightened surveillance of her work and interpersonal relationships repeated comments about her body and physical presentation expectation of her addressing internal race dynamics These dynamics are further complicated by the fact that if she were to explicitly name her experiences with race, both the organization as a whole and individuals within it will deny her experiences of racism. In fact, her attempt to address these dynamics can often become the arsenal for retaliation: the racialized woman becomes the source of the problem. She is viewed as no longer being “a good fit” or “not qualified”. She is then targeted and attacked by the organization by both formal and informal mechanisms (comments by co-workers, HR practices). In response to these experiences, the racialized woman leaves the organization, having been fired, quitting, finding a new job or going on sick leave.	https://coco-net.org/problem-woman-colour-nonprofit-organizations/

From an Indigenous woman’s standpoint, as a Goenpul woman and an academic, she ‘talks up’, engages with and interrogates western feminism in representation and practice.  Through examining an extensive range of feminist literature written mainly by white scholars and activists, Moreton-Robinson shows how whiteness dominates from a position of power and privilege as an invisible norm and unchallenged practice. She illustrates the ways in which Indigenous women have been represented in the publications and teachings of white Australian women, revealing that such renderings of Indigenous lives contrast with how Indigenous women re/present and understand themselves.	https://www.uqp.com.au/books/talkin-up-to-the-white-woman-indigenous-women-and-feminism-20th-anniversary-edition

The fact that it continues to cause trouble is the troubling part. The 'difference' challenge to mainstream feminism has tended to come in one of two forms. First, women writing from the standpoint of 'others' within or outside feminism (women whb have variously identified themselves as Black, Latina, women of colour, Third World women, Indigenous women, women of nonEnglish speaking background, lesbians, women with a disability, or a combination of these) have castigated mainstream feminism for presuming a white, AngloIFirst World, able-bodied, heterosexual and most often middleclass subject of feminist theory and activism, and for claiming that the interests of this subject are those of all women. Second, poststructuralist feminists have engaged in a thoroughgoing critique of the subject, insisting that difference resides within as well as between women, and that the category 'woman' is itself contingent, unstable, temporally and locationally specific and discursively constructed. 	https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/GriffLawRw/2001/33.html

One of the panellists, Winnie Dunn, in answering a question about the harm caused by good intentions, had used the words “white people” and “shit” in the same sentence. This raised the ire of a self-identified white woman in the audience who interrogated the panellists as to “what they think they have to gain” by insulting people who “want to read their stories.”  In other words, the woman saw a personal attack where there wasn’t one and decided to remind the panellists that as a member of the white majority she ultimately has their fate in her hands.  “I walked out of that panel frustrated,” Ibrahim wrote. “Because yet again, a good convo was derailed, white people centred themselves, and a POC panel was told to police it’s [sic] tone to make their message palatable to a white audience.”	https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/how-white-women-use-strategic-tears-to-avoid-accountability

Due to ERGs being led by volunteers, more often than not they have a lack of, or no budget – meaning being able to run events can become difficult if they are unable to bring in external speakers, or provide tea and coffee to attendees.  Volunteers are also doing this in addition to their full-time jobs which can lead them to miss out on other career opportunities.	https://www.indiversecompany.com/why-dont-employee-resource-groups-ergs-work-a-different-approach-to-diversity/

The same internal diversity exists for white Americans – most of whom were not seen as “white” upon arrival,  but became accepted as white,  gradually, over decades.  Here it is important to understand how, exactly, Americans ‘become white’. The history of Polish-Americans is an illuminating example. Upon arriving in the U.S. en masse in the late 19th and early 20th century, Poles endured discrimination based on their appearance, religion and culture.	https://thecorrespondent.com/5185/how-do-you-become-white-in-america/1466577856645-8260d4a7

2/15/2024 12:48:47	What explains recent tech layoffs, and why should we be worried? | Stanford News	What explains why so many companies are laying large numbers of their workforce off? The answer is simple: copycat behavior, according to Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.  Here, Stanford News talks to Pfeffer about how the workforce reductions that are happening across the tech industry are a result mostly of “social contagion”: Behavior spreads through a network as companies almost mindlessly copy what others are doing. When a few firms fire staff, others will probably follow suit. Most problematic, it’s a behavior that kills people: For example, research has shown that layoffs can increase the odds of suicide by two times or more.  Moreover, layoffs don’t work to improve company performance, Pfeffer adds. Academic studies have shown that time and time again, workplace reductions don’t do much for paring costs. Severance packages cost money, layoffs increase unemployment insurance rates, and cuts reduce workplace morale and productivity as remaining employees are left wondering, “Could I be fired too?”	https://news.stanford.edu/2022/12/05/explains-recent-tech-layoffs-worried/

I was then contacted by the sellers multiple times afterwards saying that the buyers were willing to sell me the lift because they were going to convert the van into a camper and didn’t need it.  Inventory has gone down, and prices have gone up. But for those of us who need something this special and particular our prices have gone up by even more than for others. I paid about 12k for a about 15-year-old vehicle in just OK condition (rust underneath and stains on the interior). Now similar vehicles of a similar year seem to be selling for even more through wheelchair van specific dealers. There are no wheelchair accessible vehicles available at that price or below in my major metropolitan area at all anymore. There are still regular vans however, many/most cheaper.	https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/11qh1fz/unintended_consequences_of_vanlife/

The panel also noted they can favour students who already have personal or socioeconomic advantages, such as principals, careers counsellors or parents who can advocate for and write letters of recommendation on their behalf.   This sort of incentivisation may prepare students for future challenges in their academic and career journeys.  It does however favour the student who performs well under test conditions and whose life circumstances enable them to work consistently all year.  It may also disadvantage those who already face challenges such as poor mental health, or those who are the first in their family to attend to university.  Drawing more students from underrepresented backgrounds into university is a key goal of the Universities Accord final report. If equity is a priority, it may be wise to rethink early offers for some vulnerable students.	https://theconversation.com/universities-accord-early-university-offers-wont-be-made-until-later-in-year-12-is-this-a-good-idea-224376

Over the years, none of my additions or changes to Wikipédia have survived. Usually because of notability issues, because women and queers have to reach stratospheric levels before they deserve even the smallest mentions on the public Wiki.  (Tangentially, I also ended up doing some small edits to some historical profiles, based on family documents (mostly correcting places of birth for a handful of ancestors) and almost all of those got reversed as well, with the erroneous information restored.)

What tribes understood then and now, is the valuable and unique outlook and perspective of women as leaders. Different life experiences influence how we approach problem solving and collaboration, enhancing our community’s ability to identify needs.    Having women in leadership has also been linked to improved financial outcomes. Tribes continue to be an economic powerhouse in Oklahoma, with CPN alone having a $693 million impact in 2023. These contributions wouldn’t be possible without the role of tribal women in the workforce who readily lend their skills and talents across a variety of industries. 	https://www.oklahoman.com/story/opinion/columns/2024/03/24/oklahoma-tribal-nations-empower-female-trailblazers-opinion/73024494007/?utm_source=oklahoman-newsalert-strada&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsalert&utm_term=hero&utm_content=nokl-oklahomacity-nletter01

3/26/2024 7:23:49	The Zone of Interest is about the danger of ignoring atrocities – including in Gaza | Naomi Klein | The Guardian	And as genocide fades further into the background of our culture, some people grow too desperate for any of these efforts. Watching the Oscars on Sunday, where Glazer was alone among the parade of wealthy and powerful speakers across the podium to so much as mention Gaza, I remembered that exactly two weeks had passed since Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old member of the US air force, self-immolated outside the Israeli embassy in Washington.  I don’t want anyone else to deploy that horrifying protest tactic; there has already been far too much death. But we should spend some time sitting with the statement that Bushnell left, words I have come to view as a haunting, contemporary coda to Glazer’s film:  “Many of us like to ask ourselves, ‘What would I do if I was alive during slavery? Or the Jim Crow south? Or apartheid? What would I do if my country was committing genocide?’ The answer is, you’re doing it.

3/28/2024 10:27:51	Education Sciences | Free Full-Text | How Diversity Fails: An Empirical Investigation of Organizational Status and Policy Implementation on Three Public Campuses	Although diversity has been a guiding preoccupation in higher education for several decades, organizational diversity practice, i.e., what happens when colleges and universities implement diversity plans, is rarely a subject of inquiry. As a result, there is relatively little empirical understanding of why diversity has failed to significantly advance racial equity on college campuses. In response, this ethnographic, collective case study draws on interviews with 54 respondents, archival and organizational documents, and campus observations to interrogate diversity practice on three campuses of different status in one public system in the U.S. This study employs Bourdieu’s theory of practice, specifically institutional habitus as an analytic lens, to examine the influence of campus social status on diversity practice related to a statewide policy. Findings reveal that each campus has a unique institutional habitus—that is, a status-linked sense of campus identity, constraints, and opportunities—that prefigured and, on most campuses, derailed diversity practice in response to the policy. Only the middle-status campus made any substantive progress. By juxtaposing these findings, this analysis demonstrates that diversity practice does not exist within a campus vacuum; instead, it is inevitably influenced, constrained, or aided by the institutional habitus of the organizational environment. The paper concludes by arguing that organizational change efforts that recognize diversity work as a situated organizational practice that reflects broader power relations can better challenge inequities to spur transformative change across educational levels and contexts.	https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/12/3/211

This is what makes our rich lifestyle possible. Beneath this surface, there exists a structure by which the cost of our consumption is extracted from the lands and labour of the people of the Global South. Without the exploitation of others who pay the cost, the Imperial Mode of Living would be unsustainable. Lowering the standard of living for those in the Global South is a prerequisite for the workings of capitalism, and the power imbalance between North and South is no anomaly - it is, in fact, a result of the system functioning normally.  We experience this way of life as desirable, though, and are loath to give it up. If we were to acknowledge the state of things in the Global South, we would be forced to lower our own standard of living. Our way of life is, in fact, a terrible thing.

Working individually and collaboratively, these women leaders share an irrepressible desire to create ground-breaking works, deeply embedded with cultural knowledge and rich in ceremonial song and performance.  Presented as part of AGSA’s acclaimed Tarnanthi program, this regional touring exhibition reflects the adaptive genius, energy and dynamism of Aṉangu culture and recognises the APY art movement as a vital source of contemporary art production in Australia today.  Kungka Kuṉpu (Strong Women) tells the inspiring tale of women supporting each other across generations, expressed through exemplary paintings, large-scale woven sculptural installations and moving image. These works centre on caring for Country, mapping significant sites and life sustaining practices of the desert; as well as sharing complex narratives surrounding family obligations and relationships. This includes the well-known Kungkarangkalpa (Seven Sisters) story about women who travel together and look after each other.	https://www.bunjilplace.com.au/events/kungka-kunpu-strong-women

The study, co-authored by Professor Tim Soutphommasane (Chief Diversity Officer), found that Britons are five times more likely to express positive views about EDI and that the initiatives are beneficial to them. The public, across ideological lines, are more likely than not to think that they personally benefit from EDI initiatives.  The study, however, also highlights the need for building greater confidence about how to speak about diversity-related matters, and for EDI initiatives to avoid reinforcing ‘us versus them’ dynamics. For example, fewer than three in 10 Britons think it is helpful to criticise people for making mistakes while handling diversity issues.	https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-03-23-oxford-co-led-study-finds-britons-favour-edi-initiatives-renewed-approach

In short, senior female leaders are often set up to fail — and this continues to happen today, as recent examples from business, politics, and academia show. Sophie Williams, a former C-suite advertising executive and global leader at Netflix, has researched why the glass cliff remains a problem and offers advice for women facing them — as well as lessons for the broader corporate world. She’s the author of the book “The Glass Cliff: Why Women in Power Are Undermined – and How to Fight Back.”	https://hbr.org/podcast/2024/03/why-the-glass-cliff-persists

Once the man started to scream for help again, Dehon jammed the taser into the man’s side and fired twice within a ten-second timeframe, arrest records state.  Shortly after Richardson was tased by officer Dehon, the officer can be seen on video approaching another officer after realizing the home where the window was broken did in fact belong to Richardson. The officer then seems to negotiate what to charge Richardson with.  “That’s pretty much his window, so there’s nothing we can do about that. So now, yeah, this is disturbing the peace with him doing all of that hollering.”  The other officer appears to agree.	https://www.wafb.com/2021/04/21/graphic-brutal-tasing-handcuffed-man-caught-louisiana-officers-body-cam/

At that point, two officers approached Nazario, guns drawn, yelling at him to get out of the car.  "What's going on?" Nazario, dressed in uniform, repeatedly asked.  Windsor Police Department officer Joe Gutierrez responded: "What's going on is you're fixing to ride the lightning, son."  Gutierrez — whose employment with the department has since been terminated following an internal investigation — and his partner, Daniel Crocker, are now the defendants in a lawsuit arguing that they violated Nazario's constitutional rights through the use of excessive force and unlawful search and seizure.  The complaint alleges that the officers' behavior is "consistent with a disgusting nationwide trend of law enforcement officers, who, believing they can operate with complete impunity, engage in unprofessional, discourteous, racially biased, dangerous, and sometimes deadly abuses of authority."	https://www.npr.org/2021/04/11/986271819/officer-who-handcuffed-and-pepper-sprayed-black-army-lieutenant-is-fired

Just over an hour later, Lambert died in police custody.   He was never given medical care, though the officers of South Boston, Va. did drive him to the hospital. He was not initially put under arrest, though the officers ultimately arrested him, shackled his hands and legs, and tased him repeatedly.  While in custody he was agitated and ran from the officers. Ambulance workers say police later claimed he fought them at a time when videos show he was actually unconscious. Police dispute that account and deny allegations of excessive force.  Over two years later, there have been no charges and no full public accounting of what happened. But a new investigation, including police videos obtained exclusively by MSNBC, shows the deadly trip for the first time.	https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/driven-hospital-virginia-man-tased-shackled-and-dies-police-custody-msna722201

The study by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) warned of a loss of legitimacy after a review of 101 Taser cases from 2015-20. They represent the most serious cases it investigated, and a fraction of more than 94,000 uses over that period – leading police to attack the findings as selective and out of date.  Previous data have shown that black people, who make up less than 4% of the UK population, face greater Taser use, leading to claims of racial bias. The IOPC said that, of the cases it reviewed, 60% of black people who were subject to Taser discharges endured them for more than five seconds, compared with 29% of white people.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/aug/25/black-people-more-likely-to-be-tasered-for-longer-police-watchdog-finds

3/31/2024 18:20:15	10-Year-Old Black Girl Arrested For Drawing of Her School Bully	For decades, activists have sounded the alarm about the school-to-prison pipeline, one of the many insidious systemic issues young Black students face every day. As recent as last year, it was reported that Black children, especially Black girls, are more likely to be criminalized and experience severe punishment over simple schoolyard conflicts that could be quietly resolved in a principal’s office.  With that said, two civil rights advocacy groups rightfully cried foul in a letter sent to the Honolulu Police Department, education department and the state attorney general’s office on Monday, demanding accountability and reforms following the arrest of a 10-year-old Black girl with ADHD. Her crime? Drawing a mean picture of her school bully.  The girl, who is referred to as “N.B.” in the letter penned by the Hawaii branch of the American Civil Liberties Union and Caballero Law LLC, was handcuffed with excessive force by police officers in front of her classmates at Honowai Elementary School in Waipahu, Hawaii, according to Hawaii News Now.   The ACLU’s letter says that the day after N.B. made the drawing of her bully in January 2020, a parent of one of the students who received the girl’s sketch complained about it being “offensive” and told the school to call the police.	https://www.theroot.com/10-year-old-black-girl-handcuffed-and-arrested-for-offe-1847901027

Mentally ill men and women, not suspected of any crime, stunned by a Taser while they lay on the ground. People already detained or incapacitated who were beaten, with police accounts falsely describing the force as necessary.  A 161-page report from the Justice Department details harrowing accounts of excessive force by the Chicago Police Department and highlights systemic failures that allow the violence to continue even as members of the public attempt to protest or report the brutality.  The investigation was launched after the death of Laquan McDonald in 2014 put Chicago's policing practices in the spotlight. Video released by court order showed a police officer shooting the black teenager in the back.  The report found an ongoing "pattern or practice" of unreasonable and excessive force — not a series of isolated events. And the violations are rarely punished, the DOJ says, as officers' descriptions of encounters are taken "at face value" even when there's contradictory evidence.	https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/13/509665735/shots-in-the-back-children-tasered-doj-details-excessive-force-by-chicago-police

The officers face a disciplinary panel starting on Monday on charges of gross misconduct, which is further alleged to be racially motivated, the Guardian has learned. They deny the charges.  Edric Kennedy-Macfoy, 32, said police had behaved like “wild animals”, dragging him from his car and subjecting him to a violent attack that culminated in him being shot with a Taser.  Since the incident in September 2011, one of the accused officers has been promoted by the Met.  Kennedy-Macfoy says he approached the officers in Harrow, north London, to help identify a young man who had thrown a rock at a police van after a late-night melee. He says officers suddenly turned on him, and he believes he was targeted because of his skin colour.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/18/met-police-officers-disciplinary-panel-black-firefighter-tasered

"It's not just the work that runs economies," explain Rose Hackman, the author of a 2023 book on the subject. "It's the work that runs families and communities. Emotional labour is manipulating the heart in order to have an effect on clients, customers, passengers, patients. It's what creates a feeling of safety and connection, meaning and belonging within a company."  It's crucial – but also taxing, and often required. Women bear the brunt. To begin, they dominate careers that demand a huge amount of emotional labour. But all workplaces require some, and especially in male-dominated offices, women are the ones doing that heavy lifting, largely without acknowledgement or recompense.	https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240313-invisible-emotional-labour-women-in-workplace

It systematically disadvantages those groups and further marginalises them within society.

The backlash hit fever pitch in 2022, when a group of B Corp-certified coffee companies alongside Portland, Oregon-based non-profit Fair World Project, wrote an open letter to B Lab Global as Nestlé-owned coffee company Nespresso received its B Corp designation in April that year. Calling out Nespresso's "abysmal track record on human rights" and "extractive business model", they asked for stricter standards across B Lab Global. 	https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240202-has-b-corp-certification-turned-into-corporate-greenwashing

Rittenhouse, the two men he killed and the man he wounded were all white, but the case has been linked from the start to issues of race and the criminal justice system.  Activists have previously pointed to differences in how police handled Rittenhouse’s case and that of Jacob Blake, the Black man who was shot by a white Kenosha police officer in August 2020, sparking protests in the city that became destructive and violent.  Video footage played during the trial showed Rittenhouse running toward police still wearing his rifle, and continuing past the police line at officers’ direction.

4/1/2024 9:37:02	Getting to the Root of the Problem: Supporting Clients With Lived-Experiences of Systemic Discrimination - Amy Bartlett, Sonya Faber, Monnica Williams, Kellen Saxberg, 2022	For many marginalized people, coping with discrimination is not a temporary condition. Rather it is endemic to living in a discriminatory society and a source of ongoing stress. In this paper, we explore the need to provide people struggling to cope with the skills to tackle not just the personal consequences of discrimination, but also to understand and address the root causes of their pain, and specifically the ones that lie outside of themselves. We propose using the concept of social capital to bring greater awareness among clients, clinicians, and society in general about the need to pair the treatment of personal distress with concurrent practices to understand and tackle larger systemic issues impacting their mental health. People with marginalized identities are often expected to find ways to cope with oppression and then sent back into a broken world, perhaps with stronger coping skills, but often ones which do not address the root cause or source of the pain, which is social injustice. We propose that it is therapeutically important to problematize, pathologize and address the systems and narratives that discriminate and cause people to need to cope, instead of focusing therapeutic interventions only on the internal resources of the person doing the coping.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/24705470221139205
4/1/2024 9:37:46	The Employment Disadvantage of Mothers: Evidence for Systemic Discrimination - Tanya Carney, 2009	When their need to provide care and their need for paid employment are equally important, mothers try to combine both roles, often through part time employment, or to stagger these competing needs by taking employment breaks. Using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics of Australia (HILDA) Survey1 this article analyses the resulting detriments to the ability of mothers to continue career paths across the occupational spectrum. Analysis of this data is used to argue that employment disadvantage is generated by mothers' inability to conform to `ideal worker' behaviour and therefore can be construed as `systemic discrimination'. Norms of `ideal' behaviour are shown to be stronger in occupations of high status and as a result mothers are at a greater risk of becoming excluded from employment within these occupations. Further, 26 percent of Australian working mothers will experience occupational exclusion, an event where further employment is secured only by moving down the occupational hierarchy to jobs of lower socio-economic status.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022185608099668

4/1/2024 9:40:44	Dissecting Discrimination in Refugee Law: an Analysis of its Meaning and its Cumulative Effect | International Journal of Refugee Law | Oxford Academic	The concept of ‘discrimination’ has several meanings and usages in refugee law. It goes to the very core of the refugee law regime, yet it does not have a clear definition. This article seeks to explore and critique the ways in which ‘discrimination’ is interpreted and applied by decision makers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. It is primarily concerned with ‘cumulative grounds discrimination’: namely, the understanding in refugee law that the cumulative effect of various discriminatory measures can amount to persecution, even where each incident of discrimination alone would not suffice. It critically analyzes the approaches of decision makers in such cases, in light of various statements of principle made by UNHCR. This article raises a number of questions, issues and inconsistencies that merit further research and consideration. It argues that decision makers should adopt a broader approach in discrimination cases: they should consider the impact of discrimination on the meaningful and effective enjoyment of rights, as well as on the individual and his or her ability to live a dignified life. The article concludes that adopting a broader approach in discrimination cases would be more consistent with fundamental principles of international human rights and refugee law: equality, non-discrimination and the inherent dignity of all human beings.	https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article-abstract/23/1/28/1589487
4/1/2024 9:41:37	Racial discrimination and child and adolescent health in longitudinal studies: A systematic review - ScienceDirect	The association between racial discrimination and adverse health outcomes has been documented across an increasing body of evidence in recent years, although a close examination of longitudinal studies has not yet taken place. This review applied a life course lens in examining the evidence for a longitudinal association between racial discrimination exposure during childhood and adolescence, and later mental and physical health outcomes.  Statistically significant associations with racial discrimination were most commonly reported for behaviour problems including delinquency and risk-taking behaviour, with significant adverse effects found in 74% of these associations. Statistically significant adverse effects were also reported in 63% of associations with health-harming behaviours including substance use, and 61% found associations with mental health outcomes. Consistently significant associations were reported between accumulated racism and later health outcomes, and the health effects of racism were reported to vary with developmental periods, although few studies featured these analyses.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953620300836

Ethnic minority people who reported exposure to racial discrimination at 1 time point had 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) mental component scores 1.93 (95% confidence interval [CI] = −3.31, −0.56) points lower than did those who reported no exposure to racial discrimination, whereas those who had been exposed to 2 or more domains of racial discrimination, at 2 different time points, had SF-12 mental component scores 8.26 (95% CI = −13.33, −3.18) points lower than did those who reported no experiences of racial discrimination. Controlling for racial discrimination and other socioeconomic factors reduced ethnic inequalities in mental health.  Conclusions. Cumulative exposure to racial discrimination has incremental negative long-term effects on the mental health of ethnic minority people in the United Kingdom. Studies that examine exposure to racial discrimination at 1 point in time may underestimate the contribution of racism to poor health.  	https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303121
4/1/2024 9:43:25	The legacies of systemic and internalized oppression: Experiences of microaggressions, imposter phenomenon, and stereotype threat on historically marginalized groups - ScienceDirect	Previous literature has described how people of historically marginalized groups (namely people of color, women, queer and transgender people, people living with disabilities, immigrants, and people of religious minority groups) are likely to internalize negative, oppressive feelings about their identities (David, 2014; David, Schroeder, & Femandez, 2019). For example, studies have found that many women and people of color (and women of color, in particular) experience what has been labeled as imposter phenomenon, or the notion that they are not intelligent or adequate enough, despite evidence that confirms their success or worth. Similarly, people of color and people from other historically marginalized groups are known to experience stereotype threat, or anxiety about performance or behaviors that could confirm biases about a social group they belong to. Finally, previous literature shows that people of historically marginalized groups navigate various types of microaggressions, or subtle or covert biased statements and behaviors that negatively impact their self-esteem, academic performance, mental health, and physical health. While the terms microaggressions, stereotype threat, and imposter phenomenon have been discussed thoroughly in academic literature, less is written about the connections between these concepts. Utilizing intersectionality theory, the current paper will propose an interactional model between these constructs and aims to describe how cumulative effects of microaggressions exacerbate and contribute to internalized oppression. Based on this model, this paper will also provide recommendations for future directions in psychological research and practice.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0732118X21000441

Giddens' structuration theory acts as a useful interpretive framework to describe how refugee agency is constrained and enabled by the rules and resources governing the employment integration process. Results show that refugees use both family and ethnic-group ties as resources in searching for employment. However, constrained by a combination of structural barriers, a significant proportion of refugees find that their human capital has little or no value in the Canadian labour market and, moreover, that the networks refugees are presently employing may not be sufficient to compensate for their downward occupational mobility.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-618X.2003.tb00235.x
4/1/2024 9:44:47	Working in unprecedented times: Intersectionality and women of color in UK higher education in and beyond the pandemic - Blell - 2023 - Gender, Work & Organization - Wiley Online Library	The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and inequities. Injustices within the labor market mean that the lives particularly of women of color have been negatively affected by the crisis in multiple ways. Guided by standpoint epistemology, we take an intersectional approach and use autoethnographic methods in which we draw on our personal experiences within the United Kingdom's higher education institutions during the pandemic. We illustrate how institutional decisions, approaches, and policies enacted in the wake of COVID-19 exacerbate inequalities and inequities. Three themes stand out from our experiences: (1) meritocracy and the problem of cumulative (dis)advantage, (2) the lack of racial awareness in management decisions, and (3) the operations of power and silencing. We show that universities justify decisions by deploying discourses of meritocracy and ignoring context and the ways women of color staff are persistently disadvantaged due to structural racism and sexism. We find that universities are likely to indicate that their response policies treat all staff absolutely equally without candidly assessing the intersectional impacts of the pandemic on minority staff, which consequently prevent the achievement of equity. We also describe the ways in which the pandemic exposes cultures of institutional silence and silencing when women of color speak up. We conclude with glimpses of hope for resisting the downward pressures of the pandemic crisis toward cultivating more equitable futures.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12907
4/1/2024 9:45:15	ERIC - ED606234 - Limiting Our Livelihoods: The Cumulative Impact of Sexual Harassment on Women's Careers, American Association of University Women, 2019-Nov	Sexual harassment has long been a significant problem for women workers. But with the emergence of the #MeToo movement, there has been a renewed public, cultural and academic focus on workplace harassment. "Limiting our Livelihoods: The Cumulative Impact of Sexual Harassment on Women's Careers" investigates the compounding impact of sexual harassment on women's economic security across their lifespan and career trajectories. This report examines the prevalence of harassment, women's experiences with sexual harassment and the cumulative impact on their economic security across the lifespan. It features original American Association of University Women (AAUW) analysis of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charge data, along with survey responses from AAUW members and individuals in their networks about their experiences with harassment. The AAUW survey data are unique because the sample reflects a group of women with a median age of 64, documenting sexual harassment of older women and the long-term economic consequences across the lifetime. The focus of this report, then, is to better understand the negative consequences of sexual harassment and the subsequent impact on women's careers and economic security, particularly in the later stages of their careers. Finally, recommendations are offered to policymakers, employers and individuals on ways to combat workplace sexual harassment and prevent its harmful long-term consequences	https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED606234
4/1/2024 9:45:27	Cumulative Effects of Bullying and Racial Discrimination on Adolescent Health in Australia - Naomi Priest, Anne Kavanagh, Laia Bécares, Tania King, 2019	This study examined how cumulative exposure to racial discrimination and bullying victimization influences the health of Australian adolescents (n = 2802) aged 10 to 11 years (19.3% visible ethnic minorities [nonwhite, non-Indigenous]; 2.6% Indigenous) using data from three waves (2010–2014) of the nationally representative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Cumulative exposure to racial discrimination and bullying victimization had incremental negative effects on socioemotional difficulties. Higher accumulated exposure to both stressors across time was associated with increased body mass index z-scores and risk of overweight/obesity. Studies that examine exposure to single risk factors such as bullying victimization or racial discrimination at one time point only are likely to miss key determinants of health for adolescents from stigmatized racial-ethnic backgrounds and underestimate their stressor burden.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022146519868847

The Differential Arrest Consequences of Victim Characteristics for Black and White Co-offenders	Black offenders are significantly more likely to be arrested than their White co-offending partners, especially for assault offenses. More importantly, this effect—for both assaults and homicides—is particularly strong when the victim is a White woman. Because these differences are between two offenders who commit the same offense together, we argue that the most plausible explanation for the differences is the presence of racial bias or discrimination. #SideBySide	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10321492/

That’s among the findings of a new data analysis led by researchers at Brown and Princeton universities.  The analysis found that teachers’ different treatment of black and white students accounted for 46% of the racial gap in suspensions and expulsions from school among 5- to 9-year-old children. It showed that about 21% of the gap could be explained by differences in the characteristics of schools that black and white children attend predominantly, while differences in student behavior accounted for 9% of the gap. #SideBySide	https://www.brown.edu/news/2019-07-18/discipline

In a 2016 survey of nearly 8,000 policemen and women from departments with at least 100 officers, two-thirds said most such encounters are isolated incidents and not signs of broader problems between police and the black community. In a companion survey of more than 4,500 U.S. adults, 60% of the public called such incidents signs of broader problems between police and black people. But the views given by police themselves were sharply differentiated by race: A majority of black officers (57%) said that such incidents were evidence of a broader problem, but only 27% of white officers and 26% of Hispanic officers said so.	https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/06/03/10-things-we-know-about-race-and-policing-in-the-u-s/

She later died after hitting her head several times while in custody. The coroner found Ms Day was “not treated with dignity and humanity” and the train conductor’s decision to call the police was influenced by “unconscious bias”.  “She was the only sleeping passenger he has ever called police to remove from the train, although he comes across three sleeping passengers a week,” the coroner wrote in her findings.

Smith-Fields’ family was never notified of her death. Smith-Field had been on a Bumble date before she passed away. Smith-Field’s case did not gain national attention until rapper Cardi B posted about the case on her social media account, which helped the story gain national attention. Black women, girls, and femmes who go missing or are found dead are rarely reported on. This lack of visibility when it comes to their stories was the reason why the #SayHerName campaign was birthed. Misogynoir in the media influences whether these stories are even reported on at all. The missing white woman syndrome equates to media coverage on the atrocities that impact white women while actively disregarding and ignoring the harm that Black, Indigenous, Asian, and other non-white people experience. #SideBySide	https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2022/02/28/the-pervasiveness-of-racism-and-bias-in-the-media/?sh=9eae6732cc48

While several overseas studies verify that reality-TV crime shows tend to portray non-white minorities as intrinsically criminal, such research is scarce in New Zealand. Our study sought to determine whether Police Ten 7 represents Māori and Pasifika (i.e., “brown”) people fairly in light of official police statistics; and, particularly, if any distorted representation suggests that Māori and Pasifika people are more violent. We analysed 12 episodes of Police Ten 7, aired in late 2020, quantitatively and compared our data with official police statistics. We found that, on Police Ten 7, Māori and Pasifika people are underrepresented as police officers and overrepresented as suspects, and overrepresented in violent offence categories. Also, most of the TV airtime dedicated to suspects is spent on Māori and Pasifika. We argue that these distortions are intensified through contrasting juxtapositions with white suspects who are underrepresented both as suspects and violent offenders, and overrepresented as harmless drunks and bad drivers. We conclude that together these distortions and contrasting juxtapositions serve to promote the image of Māori and Pasifika as the violent criminal other.	https://www.journalofglobalindigeneity.com/article/77757-young-brown-men-being-brutish-how-police-ten-7-portrays-maori-and-pacifica-people-as-violent-and-criminal-in-aotearoa-new-zealand
4/2/2024 2:08:32	Uncovering Unconscious Racial Bias - Lecture Examines Stereotypes and Their Impacts | National Academies	To study whether bias might be shaping disparities in treatment earlier in life, during schooling, Eberhardt and her colleagues gave teachers files describing a hypothetical student’s misbehavior, and asked how they would discipline the student. Half the teachers were given a file for a student named Greg — a stereotypically white name — and the other half were given an identical file for a student named Darnell, a stereotypically black name.   When a single incident of misbehavior was described, there was no difference in how teachers said they would discipline the students. But when a second incident was added, race had a large effect: Teachers wanted to discipline Darnell more harshly, and could more easily imagine suspending him in the future. For Greg, the teachers interpreted the two disruptive incidents as unrelated, while for Darnell, they saw the two incidents as a pattern of misbehavior that needed to be shut down. #SideBySide	https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2019/10/uncovering-unconscious-racial-bias-lecture-examines-stereotypes-and-their-impacts

But for images of crime-relevant objects such as guns or knives, the result was far different: Students who had been shown black faces identified the images of weapons much sooner than those who had been shown white faces or who had not been shown any photos.  The experiment illustrated not only the power of unconscious biases, but also the depth of the stereotypic association people have between blackness and crime — an association that Eberhardt has studied for nearly 20 years.  “African Americans are so associated with crime that the mere presence of a black face can lead us to see weapons more clearly,” said Eberhardt. #SideBySide	https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2019/10/uncovering-unconscious-racial-bias-lecture-examines-stereotypes-and-their-impacts
4/2/2024 2:11:49	How hidden bias can stop you getting a job	When looking for a new member of staff, employers will often draw up a list of the qualities they are looking for in potential candidates. This is a key trap where biases can creep in. Whether employers realise it or not, they often use the last person to hold a post as a benchmark for the type of candidate they’re looking for.  “In some ways people who have been successful in roles in the past become a prototype or reference point for success in our minds,” says Siri Uotila, a research fellow at the Women and Public Policy Program at the ‎Harvard Kennedy School. “If the majority have been white men, then it is more difficult to actively diversify the population."	https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180806-how-hidden-bias-can-stop-you-getting-a-job

This bias was compounded if the candidate fit into multiple categories that are often discriminated against. Obese women, for example, were considered even less suitable for the job than obese men.  “People who are overweight are considered lazy and less intelligent – stereotypes that are unfounded,” says Flint. “There’s no evidence they are less able to do the work or are less intelligent than an average-weight person.” #SideBySide	https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180806-how-hidden-bias-can-stop-you-getting-a-job

4/2/2024 21:21:38	Research Finds Evidence of Racial Bias in Plea Deals	A new study from Carlos Berdejó of Loyola Law School finds significant racial disparities in plea deals that suggest that prosecutors may be using race as a proxy for criminality.  Recent studies on racial disparities in the criminal justice system have focused on arrests, initial charging, and sentencing, and they generally find that African Americans are more likely to be arrested and charged – and they receive harsher sentences – than white people. Fewer researchers have examined the plea-bargaining process, even though the overwhelming majority of criminal cases in the United States are resolved through plea deals.	https://eji.org/news/research-finds-racial-disparities-in-plea-deals/

For many Americans, it is now frighteningly clear that police consider Black people suspects when sitting in their backyards, failing to signal, and simply going about many daily life activities — and that this racial targeting too often results in callous abuses, unjust imprisonment, and senseless killings at law enforcement’s hands. Tragically, policing is only one of many racial discrimination pitfalls in America’s criminal justice system, merely representing the first step in a deeply problematic process.	https://www.naacpldf.org/racism-wrongful-convictions-mass-incarceration/

In 2004, Andre Thomas, a Black man, killed his white wife and their two children during a schizophrenic episode. He also attempted to kill himself at the scene and subsequently gouged out both of his eyes. At Thomas’ capital trial, the jury had to assess his severe mental illness when considering his insanity defense and then decide whether he should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Despite the substantial impact that their decision would have on Thomas’ future, three jurors were allowed to serve after openly condemning interracial relationships, a bias that could’ve unquestionably impacted their decision. Thomas has been on death row ever since.	https://www.naacpldf.org/racism-wrongful-convictions-mass-incarceration/

Premised on observed defendant and case characteristics, judges impose sentences that are approximately 13 percent longer for Black defendants and 19 percent longer for Hispanic defendants than the sentences imposed for white defendants.  The study did find that the standard deviation in imposed sentences for all other racial groups was actually 10 percent lower than that of white defendants. The study reveals that its aggregate results concerning racial disparities is in line with previous studies. It can also be inferred from the data that slightly higher aggregate disparities may exist that were not found in data analyses results compiled from earlier time spans using different sampling mechanisms	https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2022/jun/15/racially-disparate-sentencing-patterns-prevalent-amongst-federal-judges/

Mississippi — Harvard Undergraduate Law Review	However, the fourth, fifth, and sixth appeals were on account of the prosecutor, Doug Evans, engaging in racial discrimination during jury selection by way of peremptory strikes. The State was “relentless” in its efforts to strike Black jurors from the prospective jury pool: in the third trial, it used all 15 of its peremptory strikes against prospective Black jurors, then 11 strikes in the fourth, and five out of six strikes in the sixth [9]. Although the Supreme Court had previously ruled in Batson v. Kentucky (1986) that the use of peremptory strikes to remove a juror solely on the basis of race was unconstitutional, the ongoing prejudiced use of this legal mechanism is a stark reminder of racially charged elements still pertinent in our criminal justice system [10]. 	https://hulr.org/fall-2021/disparate-racial-sentencing-in-lieu-of-jones-v-mississippi

The reality is that these events are also impacting children. Youth today are growing up in what has been described as an “era of mistrust” of police.  Across racial and ethnic groups, youths’ perceptions of police have dropped in recent years to a decades-long low. Yet, the amount of the decline differs across demographic groups. In fact, Black youth report the most dramatic declines, and the gap between their perceptions and white youths’ perceptions has been increasing.	https://theconversation.com/kids-perceptions-of-police-fall-as-they-age-for-black-children-the-decline-starts-earlier-and-is-constant-145511

4/3/2024 9:31:51	8 Ways the Media Upholds White Privilege and Demonizes People of Color - Everyday Feminism	For instance, young white men responsible for horrible mass shootings are often given the “brilliant loner” treatment. Headlines describing killers like Adam Lanza and James Holmes as “smart,” “quiet,” and “nice” are common.  On the other hand, when young people of color are the victims of violence, they still rarely get their accomplishments named in the mainstream media.  In McKinney, Texas, white neighbors yelled racial slurs and physically assaulted a group of youth of color at a pool party – and things got even worse when a police officer called to the scene wrestled unarmed Black teenager Dejerria Becton to the ground, pulled a gun on her friends, and sat on her to restrain her.  So when Fox News’s Megyn Kelly talked about that horrible incident, she could’ve researched Dejerria Becton’s achievements. She could’ve focused on the fact that Dejerria was an innocent party who was invited to the honorable act of celebrating a friend’s graduation, AND who was following the officer’s instructions before he attacked her.  Instead, Kelly said that the girl was “no saint,” so rather than seeing her as an innocent victim of violence, viewers can believe that this young girl had it coming. #SideBySide	https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/07/the-media-white-privilege/

Like the fact that Bland was a Black woman living in a country, state, and county where racist violence has been weaved into everyday life since the day Bland was born, and for centuries before that.  But one media outlet chose to frame the narrative this way: “Woman Found Dead in Jail Cell Had Prior Run-Ins With Law.”  It’s true – Sandra Bland had been pulled over like this before. Several of those “run-ins” were citations for unpaid traffic tickets. Her last encounter with police was the fatal one, but like other people of color who are targets, it wasn’t the only one.   If you weren’t paying attention, you might think a dangerous hardened criminal – not the real Sandra Bland – had just died in jail.	https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/07/the-media-white-privilege/

Similarity plays a significant factor in this equation: more often than not, someone considered a “good culture fit” is someone “I’d want to grab a beer with,” someone “like me.”  Who is the “me” in this scenario? According to research on Fortune 500 companies, the majority of organizational hiring managers and leadership are white men. It is no surprise that a cycle of exclusion is perpetuated when most Americans have largely homogenous friend and peer groups and a large percentage of hiring happens through these networks.

A groundbreaking project exploring how better to boost public support for action against systemic racism tested which messages best move people towards a more anti-racist position.  Reframing Race, a charity, tested dozens of arguments on almost 20,000 people and found highlighting research from 2019 showing ethnic minority applicants received less positive responses to job applications than white people, was the “blockbuster” in terms of making people more likely to agree that all races and ethnic groups are equally as capable as one other.	https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/dec/15/job-discrimination-faced-by-ethnic-minorities-convinces-public-about-racism

Today, I blame that predicament on the lack of leadership diversity on my nonprofit’s board, a widespread problem I now research as an academic scholar. Imbalances of power create opportunities for the people who have historically called the shots to abuse their authority – whether that means paying people of color less than whites for the same work or committing the kinds of outrages that the #MeToo movement and its offshoots are now bringing to light.	https://theconversation.com/why-most-nonprofit-boards-resemble-whiteboards-and-how-to-fix-that-89623

This gap in how professionals experience their workplaces — whether they receive mentorship, are granted promotions, or face microaggressions — is partially reflected in what we call the ‘white advantage,’” write Frances Kunreuther and Sean Thomas-Breitfeld, Co-Directors of the Building Movement Project, and authors of the report, Race to Lead Revisited: Obstacles and Opportunities in Addressing the Nonprofit Racial Leadership Gap.  	https://racetolead.org/nonprofits-so-white-new-report-on-lack-of-inclusion-offers-strategies/

We’ve been having this conversation for at least the past 15 years, and funny enough, it’s still just that—a conversation. But that’s one of the key pillars of modern polite white supremacy, isn’t it? The uncanny ability to talk in circles about an issue, without ever taking action on the issue. In fact, the conversation is glorified as though it were the action itself. Organizations introducing and discussing the racial gap in nonprofit leadership is seen as the equivalent of doing the work to bridge the gap.  Why is it that nonprofits are still over 80 percent white-led?  Why does that number increase to 90 percent when it comes to the 315 largest nonprofits in the country?

4/3/2024 11:20:15	The Link Between Race and Power: White Women in Non-Profit Leadership, a discussion with Michelle Gislason - The Prosperity Agenda	The term is “smog of racism” and its connection to power and authority of whiteness. What does this term mean and how does that connect to your own story?  Michelle Gislason: Sure. Well, it’s definitely not my term. It’s Beverly Daniel Tatum who coined the term. So, I want to acknowledge that, first. Definitely, this term has impacted my own story. Last year, I traveled to Idaho for a national gathering of movement leaders. At the time, I don’t know if you remember, there were three sides of Washington state surrounded by wildfires. The fire has made the air really heavy with ash and pollution, which I could see as I was flying into Boise, Idaho. As I was driving to the hotel, I couldn’t help comment about the pollution levels that were really high, which was obviously interfering with people’s daily lives.  It also left me with a heavy feeling that is quite similar to the smog of racism. Beverly Daniel Tatum talks about where she equates smog to racism. Like in Charlottesville and other parts of the country where there’s this thick and really heavy smog that descends onto the community. Like with racism, with a capital “R” and white nationalism, with a capital “W” is everywhere. You just can’t avoid it. It’s so thick that you can actually see it in front of you. But, there’s also a different kind of smog. There’s lowercase smog that lingers, and is actually really insidious. 	https://theprosperityagenda.org/2019/05/23/white-women-in-non-profit-leadership-michelle-gislason/

It is demonstrated how such discrimination may impact on the afflicted person's sense of self, suggesting a theoretical model of the embodiment of discrimination. Discrimination not only works at an interpersonal and institutional level, but is a form of ‘symbolic violence’ that may be internalized to affect the person's ‘habitus’; it can be resisted through meaning-making activity that explains and hence objectifies and embodies the experience in a way that allows individuals to positively influence their situation through agency.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02017.x
4/3/2024 11:31:59	Businesses | Free Full-Text | Examining the Impact of Gender Discriminatory Practices on Women’s Development and Progression at Work	Although there has been a worldwide cry for gender equity within organizations, gender discriminatory practices continue to be a challenge. Many women still suffer from gender discrimination and remain at the bottom of organizational structures despite their efforts to ascend. This paper seeks to examine the link between gender discriminatory practices and women’s skill development and progression within the workplace. The study espoused a quantitative approach. A questionnaire survey was self-administered online to 412 women through a convenient non-probability sampling method. Descriptive tendencies, test normality, validity, reliability, and regression analysis were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS), AMOS 27. The results reveal that women’s skill development is impacted by workplace gender discriminatory practices, and the career progression of women is linked to their skill development. Yet it rejects the claim that workplace gender discriminatory practices impact women’s career progression. While having a gender-friendly work environment is applaudable, developing women’s skills and promoting their advancement at work will require more effort from companies. Organizations need to be deliberate about the skills development and career progression of women and institutionalize initiatives that directly encourage women to engage in developmental activities as well as initiatives geared towards promoting women’s career advancement.	https://www.mdpi.com/2673-7116/3/2/22

As a result, the purpose of this study is to investigate perceptions of discrimination and career advancement among African American accountants, the second largest minority group in accounting today, and reveal any differences between males and females. Although research on African American accountants exists, it does not empirically investigate male/female differences related to perceived discrimination (race and gender), perceived career curtailment, and intent to remain. To address this dearth of research focus, this study analyzes survey results from 553 African American accountants, primarily employed in nonpublic accounting organizations. The results suggest females perceive more race and gender discrimination in private industry and other sectors, than in public accounting, and males perceive race discrimination in all three industry types. Females are less likely to remain with their current employers in all three industry types, than their male counterparts, and only females employed in the other sectors (e.g., governmental and education) feel their career advancements have been curtailed.	https://publications.aaahq.org/api/article-abstract/7/1/26/6396/Upward-Mobility-and-the-African-American

While this may yield positive benefits for underrepresented groups working within the construction industry, it remains to be seen whether this legislative drive has overcome indirect forms of discrimination brought about by the ingrained culture and working practices of the sector. This paper explores the impact of indirect discrimination by systematically combining the results of two research projects which explored perspectives on women’s careers in the industry. The first examined the ways in which women’s careers were affected by the nature of working practices within the U.K. construction industry, while the second explored gendered perspectives on work-life balance within the context of the Australian construction sector. Taken in combination, the findings provide prima facie evidence of how construction companies disadvantage women’s careers through their work practices and cultures. Based on this evidence, this paper develops a grounded proposition that the ingrained structures and work cultures of the sector, combined with women’s restricted occupational choices, stymie attempts to create an equitable workplace environment. Suggestions are made as to how construction companies can encourage the structural and cultural shift necessary to overcome the corrosive effect of indirect discrimination on women’s careers in the future.	https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2006)22:3(108)

An example of segregation and discrimination against women? | European Heart Journal | Oxford Academic	Aims The aim of this study was to analyse the processes through which job, career and research-related choices are determined in Italian cardiology, focusing on characteristics such as productivity, gender and family.  Methods and Results In June 1996, a questionnaire surveying individual and career-related data was mailed to all members (8000) of the Italian societies of cardiology. Returned questionnaires numbered 1715 (21·4% of the total mailed), 83% were completed by men and 17% by women. For both hospital and academic careers, advancement in rank was influenced by variables denoting productivity, family and individual characteristics. However, men and women showed slightly different patterns.  Conclusions Promotion to the upper ranks of the hierarchy was highly dependent upon time (once the effects of the covariates were eliminated). This situation is typical of the internal labour market, that is, in institutions in which staff members are ranked on a hierarchical scale according to formal criteria that are ‘rigid’ and institutionalized, partially sheltered from competition. Therefore, once a member has gained access to the bottom of the hierarchy, the professional career is ‘pre-determined’ and seniority has an appreciable influence on promotion decisions; in this context, women appear to be at a disadvantage.	https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/20/17/1276/452624

It focuses on career progression, support available for promotion and particular initiatives for staff retention. The findings suggest that whilst some progress has been made to support White and Black and minority ethnic women in their career trajectories, greater change is needed in order that inclusion is embedded within institutional frameworks and strategic plans. Furthermore, clearer evidence is needed by universities to demonstrate how they are meeting their legal equality requirements as specified by the Equality Act (2010). The mere presence of diversity and equality policies does not necessarily demonstrate that gender and ethnic inequalities are being addressed. Such policies may simply result in a ‘tick box’ exercise. In order to address such inequalities, issues of diversity and equality must be embedded within the cultural organisation of institutions which are identified in key objectives resulting in real outcomes and practice. Additionally, there is a need to consider intersectional identities and the impact of ethnicity on women’s experiences in higher education.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02671522.2019.1615118

This course is at present only offered in London and Leeds, but it is intended to ‘roll out’ to other regions in the future. There are two relevant contextual factors for the research: the growing ethnic diversity of the school and student population, which is not matched by an equivalent growth in the proportion of BME teachers and school leaders; and the current recruitment and retention crisis relating to school leaders, which has led to a greater national focus on recruiting women and BME staff to leadership roles. The stages of career progress from preparation through establishment to advancement or development and finally to acquisition and performance of the role of head teacher form the framework for discussion of the career paths of the BME staff interviewed, identifying facilitators and barriers to career progress. Drawing on the findings of Bush et al., this article identifies the perceptions and career aspirations of a group of BME leaders who had attended a leadership course. The data indicate the multiple identities of these leaders who have met structural barriers including racism, but who have exercised individual agency in their career progress. Although the participants work in London, lessons can be drawn relating to recruitment and retention issues of BME educational leaders that have implications nationally and internationally.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13632430903509741

The paper also examines the factors such as national culture, gender stereotypes and leadership, work and family conflict, mentoring and informal networks that impact on the career progression of women academics in two different cultural settings, namely Mauritius and Australia.  Design/methodology/approach Thirty in‐depth interviews from two universities were used.  Findings The findings illustrate that the barriers to progression are remarkably similar to women from both universities despite their different cultural background. Women in the Mauritian context face a considerably more conservative cultural climate that may negatively impact on their career progression. Women from both cultural settings face significant barriers to career progression in their academic roles.  Originality/value This paper compares Australian and Mauritian women academics experience in academia. The paper also offers practical guidance that can be used by management and women academics to facilitate career progression of women in academia.	https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09649420610692499/full/html

But in addition to intervening, there are other important ways to support people who experience microaggressions, systemic inequities and other barriers to opportunity — and one way is through microafffirmations.  In contrast to microaggressions, microaffirmations are little ways that you can affirm someone’s identity; recognize and validate their experience and expertise; build confidence; develop trust; foster belonging; and support someone in their career. Microaffirmations can help mitigate and disrupt the harmful effects of historical oppression, systemic inequity, cultural marginalization and personal biases.	https://ideas.ted.com/how-to-be-an-ally-in-the-workplace-13-ways-to-do-it/

A study of over 5,000 Canadians finds that women, the LGBTQ2+ community, and Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour (BIPOC) employees who have allies at work are 1.6 times less likely to perceive obstacles in their day-to-day environment and twice as likely to say their workplace is bias-free (see Exhibit 1).

Allyship is important in making sure that everyone is not only invited to the table but is also heard, acknowledged, and recognized for their contributions.  Being an ally is by no means easy. Would-be male allies may struggle to identify subtle forms of sexism or exclusion at work and fear backlash when they speak out. Research suggests that men may be unsure how to be an ally and have trouble navigating power dynamics at work. But a commitment to equity, as well as support from other men, can help motivate men to act as allies.	https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/nine_tips_for_being_a_male_ally_at_work

We hired the Harvard guy on merit.  However, he was BIPOC, the recruiter knew this, and had slowly pushed him out of the process.  A Harvard candidate roundfiled by a BIPOC recruiter because he was BIPOC and she wanted to get paid.  I found a lot of resumes like that when I went back through her reject pile.  My techbro boss didn't care about that, but he did care about losing supposed prestige from missing out on name brand hires.    The very large company this happened at had a clear (and completely unenforced) DEI policy.  Many companies are like that.  There is also a lot of internal pressure among white (mostly male) managers to maintain a status quo.  Prior job, I instituted a similar "blind hire" process, because the techbro candidates that made it through the prior process, well, sucked.  	https://disabled.social/@undead@hackers.town/112214022960474881

These are areas of privately, group or communally owned land, leased for the conservation of wildlife and their habitats. In Kenya, these leases can be for as long as 25 years.  But conservancies face their own challenges. Particularly because of how land is owned and who participates in the model.  Our study in Kenya’s Mara ecosystem reveals that land-rich older men reap the biggest rewards, often at the expense of women, young people and the landless poor.  This trend underlines a challenge in conservation efforts: balancing the interests of wildlife preservation with the rights and well-being of local communities who have been the custodians of these lands for generations.	https://theconversation.com/kenyas-wildlife-conservancies-make-old-men-rich-while-making-women-and-young-people-poorer-225184

Many open source communities struggle to achieve strong community participation from Asia despite the region representing 60% of the world population. For example many community leaders are predominantly from the US or Europe, and many open source surveys have very low participation from Asia. Despite numerous participants from India and China, their actual presence is disproportionately low. Why is that? An obvious reason could be the time zone differences, however as a Japanese woman who grew up and worked in Japan, and as a wife and a mother, it seems probable this could be explained by culture and other social barriers like language. Although we appreciate the benefit of diversity in open source, it remains challenging to have an optimally balanced community. Do we compromise and convince ourselves by having a nominal representation per region? Or do we look for ways to enable real benefit from multiple perspectives? Many DEI factors are grouped together which removes our ability to identify areas needing improvement. Asia consists of 40 countries whose culture and languages are very different. Asians who grew up in the US may have different perspectives from those who grew up in Asia. Let’s look at our goals again to see what communities can actually do to bring real value.	https://osseu2023.sched.com/event/1OGgS/diversity-in-open-source-an-asian-perspective-masae-shida-vmware

Around 37% of the population – 17.7 million people – are staring famine in the face.	https://africanfeminism.com/sudans-women-bear-scars-of-brutality-amid-unending-war/

People aren’t foolish for using IoT or for wanting things to be easier in their homes. This tech makes positive and meaningful change for people of all kinds of abilities. It’s valid to worry about the privacy or security issues that IoT is riddled with, but don’t draw a direct line from there to blaming the user - some people have no alternatives that don’t involve giving up independent access to their own homes and lives. Everyone deserves to live in ways that fit their needs.  Instead, join the push to hold manufacturers and providers to account for poor security and privacy practices. Advocate for better, more respectful and accessible default configurations. Help people understand how to anticipate and mitigate the worst of these issues when they’re setting things up, and give them power and agency over their home systems.  We all deserve to have tech that works for us, in all the ways that matters.	https://disabled.social/@attacus@aus.social/112205269196314647

One of the police officers noticed Sarana and proceeded to question whether Sarana identified as male or female. She responded, “I am Sarana. I am on my way home from a Valentine’s Day party.”  Aunty Tolu was at the station the following day, seeking more information on Saratu’s arrest and detention. The Investigating Police Officer stated that Saratu would be charged with “displaying unnatural offence and immoral acts in public.” The police officer also said that people like Sarana needed rehabilitation and kept on referring to her as “he.”  With cold anger, Aunty Tolu turned to the police officer and said: “Sarana is a woman. You need to respect her for who she is! She has not violated the Nigerian constitution in any way!” Aunty Tolu ferociously defended Saratu’s identity as a woman even when police threatened to lock her up with Sarana. She was adamant about her stance.   Despite her experience the previous night, Sarana was surprised and excited that another woman boldly addressed her as a woman, irrespective of the people present at the police station.

We report on conceptual and geographic trends within the literature, including the practice of assessing local knowledge against scientific benchmarks, and present results of a textual network analysis that illustrates overlap and co-occurrence among different characterizations of local knowledge. In critically assessing the dominant trends we draw special attention to problems associated with the extraction of local knowledge without due consideration of how this process is embedded and inextricable from local contexts and sociotechnical orders. Drawing on theories of science and technology that examine the ontological politics of research practices, we propose a co-productive path forward for local knowledge mobilization to inform adaptation decision-making, which we argue facilitates the transformation of the institutional and governance arrangement of climate adaptation to provide greater flexibility and experimentalism in research and decision-making.

Researchers seeking to ‘preserve’ microbial species associated with Indigenous groups, but absent from industrialized populations, have largely failed to include Indigenous people in knowledge co-production or benefit, perpetuating a legacy of intellectual and material extraction. We propose a framework centred on relationality among Indigenous peoples, researchers and microbes, to guide ethical microbiome research. Our framework centres accountability to flatten historical power imbalances that favour researcher perspectives and interests to provide space for Indigenous worldviews in pursuit of Indigenous research sovereignty. Ethical inclusion of Indigenous communities in microbiome research can provide health benefits for all populations and reinforce mutually beneficial partnerships between researchers and the public.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01471-2
4/6/2024 9:11:45	"Amazonian Women’s Practices of Forest-Making in Ecuador" by Andrea Sempértegui	In October 2013, a group of indigenous women from the southeastern Ecuadorian Amazon started the “March of Life”. This 250-km long march – organized and led entirely by female representatives from the Achuar, Shuar, Zapara, Kichwa, Shiwiar, Andoa, and Waorani indigenous organizations – proceeded from the Amazonian city of Puyo to the capital city of Quito and was a response to the 11th oil licensing round in their territories. After this symbolic and arduous march, Amazonian women have continued to organize as a network and as active members of their indigenous organizations against renewed attempts by the government of licensing their territories to extractive companies, making their voices heard in the national media and their proposals more visible within the broader spectrum of environmental, anti-extractive and popular feminist struggles in Ecuador. This is the case of their proposal to declare the Amazon a “Living Forest,” publicly presented to the Ecuadorian National Assembly in 2013. Departing from my colabor ethnography with five leaders and members from this network – Elvia Dagua, Zoila Castillo, Rosa Gualinga, Nancy Santi, and Salomé Aranda –, and decolonial, feminist and Latin American indigenous thought, this paper reflects about the role of Amazonian women’s concrete practices that make the Amazon a “living forest” and that sustain their territorial struggle. Practices like cultivating the land, weaving clay pottery, sharing dreams in the mornings, or singing “with a purpose” are practices that not only build affective relations between the human and non-human, but that constantly recognize, relate to and even make the forest into a living entity. At the same time, these practices of forest-making nurture Amazonian women’s organizational strategies – e.g. when they sing at meetings with representatives from the government – and political discourse when confronting the state and oil companies. With this analysis, I hope to shed light on how Amazonian women’s territorial struggle is decolonizing environmental imaginaries about the Amazon as an untouched territory to be preserved, makes evident the continuum between resistance strategies and the reproduction of human and non-human life in the rainforest, and is transforming the anti-extractive struggle at large.	https://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol21/iss7/10/
4/6/2024 9:12:01	Indigenous Peoples | 28 | Extraction and Extractivism | John-Andrew Mc	The severe impacts of extractive development on Indigenous peoples are evident in the global historical record of colonialism and contemporary projects of state-building and corporate-led development. Summarizing elements of this record, this chapter highlights the physical impacts and diverse responses made by Indigenous peoples in response to the threats to their lands and livelihoods caused by projects of resource extraction. Rejecting the logic of extractivism, Indigenous communities have advocated practices that integrate the sustainable use of the local environment, respect for the agency of nature, and respect for custom and tradition and self-determination. This moderated participation in resource extraction suggests Indigenous peoples’ common desire to avoid destructive extractive logics. Many Indigenous communities in both the Andean highlands and lowlands have strong traditions of small-scale ancestral or artisanal mining. Indigenous participation in resource extraction also takes place at larger scales.	https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003153085-28/indigenous-peoples-john-andrew-mcneish
4/6/2024 9:12:16	Decolonizing both researcher and research and its effectiveness in Indigenous research - Ranjan Datta, 2018	How does one decolonize and reclaim the meanings of research and researcher, particularly in the context of Western research? Indigenous communities have long experienced oppression by Western researchers. Is it possible to build a collaborative research knowledge that is culturally appropriate, respectful, honoring, and careful of the Indigenous community? What are the challenges in Western research, researchers, and Western university methodology research training? How have ‘studies’ – critical anti-racist theory and practice, cross-cultural research methodology, critical perspectives on environmental justice, and land-based education – been incorporated into the university to disallow dissent? What can be done against this disallowance? According to Eve Tuck and K Wayne Yang’s (2012) suggestion, this article did not use the concept of decolonization as a substitute for ‘human rights’ or ‘social justice’, but as a demand of an Indigenous framework and a centering of Indigenous land, Indigenous sovereignty and Indigenous ways of thinking. This article discusses why both research and researcher increasingly require decolonization so that research can create a positive impact on the participants’ community, and conduct research ethically. This article is my personal decolonization and reclaiming story from 15 years of teaching, research and service activities with various Indigenous communities in various parts of the world. It presents a number of case studies of an intervention research project to exemplify the challenges in Western research training, and how decolonizing research training attempts to not only reclaim participants’ rights in the research but also to empower the researcher. I conclude by arguing that decolonizing research training creates more empathetic educators and researchers, transforming us for participants, and demonstrating how we can take responsibility for our research.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1747016117733296

As a direct challenge to mining extraction, the proverb asserts a profound guardianship role, laid down by creation heroes and enacted by our ancestor’s intent on maintaining healthy conditions and peaceful lives in Garrwa country. Garrwa territory lies in the South West Gulf of the Northern Territory, a region with ancient interwoven storytelling traditions. The Garrwa world resonates with stories and songs for sustaining life and our relational ways of being. These protests occurred in the first year of my PHD study. This study looks towards understanding the renewal of ancient song traditions through Indigenous video. The study reveals how our ancient song traditions contain dynamic world-making doctrines and cultural powers that are sourced from creation journeys, yet extend across social, cultural and political spheres. It is here that we reveal the synergies between ancient guardianship roles and the alliances that are emerging within movements in support of Indigenous self-determination and sustainability. This chapter focuses on understanding Yarnbar Jarngkurr, ‘talk story’, as an emergent creative Indigenous methodology & shielding strategy within the family protests of October 2014. Yarnbar Jarngkurr is an expression of the family way of being, of Garrwa self determination and an emergent decolonizing framework for meaningful research collaboration. This paper explores two foundational alignments within this framework: relational being and enactment of intent. Carefully framed Indigenous research collaborations hold transformative potential to revitalize our languages and contribute to sustainable movements in contemporary life. A conscious transdisciplinary shift would forge deeper understandings of relational being as a collective positioning and continue manifesting interconnectedness through new communicative models of autonomous sustainability and healthy living.	https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-93743-4_14
4/6/2024 9:13:21	Extractive Research Archives - CREATE Initative	When pursuing community-engaged research-based partnership, there is a growing awareness that the “extractive” and “directive” models are unacceptable.  The “directive” model is business-as-usual, in which “best practices” emerge from university research with the expectation that communities should change their priorities and practices accordingly. Researchers who recognize the limitations of that approach may prioritize “engagement” but can sometimes practice an “extractive” approach, which centers questions that the researcher and their colleagues are interested in, unfolds according to university timelines, and seldom results in research findings or products that meet the needs of communities.  When conducted in the name of equity and with or “on” historically marginalized and under-resourced communities, this approach is especially problematic, as it creates additional burdens on these communities while burnishing the “expert” credentials for researchers with unclear impacts on equity outcomes.	https://create.umn.edu/tag/extractive-research/

The history of the social science research is one of extractivist research practices; Anthropology is particularly populated by researchers guilty of exploiting cultural differences with a one-way flow of knowledge accumulating as academic prestige. Thus it is my challenge as a researcher of extractive industries to ensure my research does not replicate extractive relations with the communities I am researching with.	https://www.wegoitn.org/going-beyond-extractive-methodologies-to-research-extractivism/
4/6/2024 9:14:13	Full article: Forgotten publics: considering disabled perspectives in responsible research and innovation	Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in healthcare requires a more substantial engagement with disability theory and disabled stakeholders to counteract histories of disenfranchisement in scientific and technological innovation. Historically, disability has been configured as undesirable pathology in medicine, often assuming successes in innovation can be measured by crossing the constructed threshold between disabled and able. Employing a disability-informed perspective in RRI for healthcare innovations means dismantling passive patient roles in favor of active and meaningful engagement, contextualizing participation in histories of exclusion from public life, and creating physical, infrastructural, and social spaces that value and encourage disabled perspectives. Ultimately, this piece argues that recognizing disability as a crucial epistemic resource can aid in the production of more transparent, inclusive, and meaningful research and innovation.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23299460.2020.1831366
4/6/2024 9:14:24	Full article: Participatory research: working with vulnerable groups in research and practice	Participatory research and the involvement of disabled people in the research process is a central tenet of disability studies and, along with the social model of disability, was one of the two key concepts that underpinned the discipline when it first started to emerge in academia in the mid-1980s. Whilst Mike Oliver was later to take the basic ideas of participatory research and redefine them to prioritise a focus on emancipation and challenging the oppression and disadvantage experienced by disabled people, this was in part at least to be achieved through changing the social relations of research production, turning disabled people from the object of research into active agents in the research process. In this short, concise and very clearly written book, Jo Aldridge draws on her experience of participatory research across a range of different settings working with a variety of research participants to examine both participatory research’s role and its potential in work with marginalised and vulnerable groups. Whilst, as Aldridge makes clear in her introduction, the use of the term vulnerable is contentious, its use is justified on pragmatic and ethical grounds and, not surprisingly and very appropriately, the ethics of participatory research is central to the book. What makes Participatory Research particularly useful is the way that Aldridge has drawn on her own extensive experience of participatory research across a range of populations, including children and young people, people with a learning disability and people who have been victims of abuse and trauma, particularly women who have been subject to sexual abuse, to ground her arguments. Further, not only is Aldridge able to draw on her experience across different populations but she has in her career to date employed a variety of methods, and bringing together different research methods including visual methods and narrative research within a participatory research paradigm make this a valuable resource for anybody carrying out or planning participatory research.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2016.1208986

It argues that extractive operations rely on refugees’ active participation to their own governmentality—what I define as participatory confinement. The piece engages with feminist literature on unpaid labor and shows that participatory confinement implies that refugees perform unpaid labor activities, which are disguised as voluntary work. It moves on by conceptualizing participatory confinement through the lens of the invitation to governmentality. In order to develop this, the article focuses on two modes of participatory confinement: unpaid labor that asylum seekers do as “voluntary” activities and knowledge and data extraction. It concludes by questioning extractive humanitarianism in light of the subtle coercion and invisible exploitation that asylum seekers are exposed to.	https://academic.oup.com/ccc/article-abstract/15/2/176/6573768?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false
4/6/2024 9:20:09	The Unpaid Labor of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities in Institutional and Community-based Disability Services - New Politics	The work experience of persons with intellectual disabilities remains overlooked in much of the literature. In part, this is because of an emphasis on paid work. As persons with intellectual disabilities have historically experienced low rates of employment, their place within labor studies and their contributions in the world of work are often overlooked. Furthermore, because of their absence from paid employment there is a misconception that persons with intellectual disabilities cannot or do not work. However, as I will illustrate, while this notion has been reinforced over time through exclusionary and exploitive social policies presented as rehabilitation and training, "work" is in fact central to the history of disability policy and programs for persons with intellectual disabilities. A closer examination of programs within institutions and the community reveal the legacy of unpaid, exploitive, and invisible labor that directly challenges these misconceptions.	https://newpol.org/unpaid-labor-persons-intellectual-disabilities-institutional-and-community-based-disability/

In 2022 at the Gap State High School in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, for the first time in the history of a STEM subject offered at the high school, a large number of young females choose to study this STEM subject. The authors took this opportunity to run a unique study that tried to under- stand the influences on this decision. We ran a structured survey with Likert scale or Yes/No responses on an anonymised group of survey participants to better understand the influences behind their choices to study STEM in year 9. Most studies in this field ask young females why they did not choose a STEM subject but this study provides one of few studies surveying high school students at an early point in their school journey (instead of during college) finding out why they did choose the STEM subject. The results from the survey are then compared against policy choices showing there is disagreement between some chosen policy decisions and the recommen- dations here. The recommendations from the data presented here also provide schools with a practical and useful framework to support young females in choosing STEM subjects.	https://search.informit.org/doi/10.3316/informit.T2024031600016201174722318

If you consider yourself a "scholar-activist" but aren't making the findings of your research available to the very communities whose data you're collecting and disaggregating, then you're merely a scholar and can drop the hyphen as well as the word 'activist' (much less ally or co-conspirator) from your title.  Moreover, being complacently satisfied with fancy research publications sitting in some obscure ivory tower library collecting dust underscores the existential contradiction of academics who perpetuate the same inequities they purport to subvert.

It cannot possibly be like a story written by a white woman. A white woman has only one handicap to overcome—that of sex. I have two—both sex and race.

Chance, 2022	This article explores adversity and the lived experiences of Black women in higher education leadership. Using phenomenology, this study specifically explores how Black women in higher education leadership navigate the adverse challenges of intersectionality, stereotype threat, and tokenism. Black women in leadership undergo adversity including limited role models, the concrete ceiling, and the intersectionality of racism, sexism, and ageism, as well as tokenism. The current findings validate that Black women in higher education leadership experience adversity. Some of the more salient codes that emerged were discrimination such as racism, sexism, ageism, and the intersection of these challenges with identity, cultural diversity and belonging, resilience, and leadership callings. Referred to as “superwomen,” Black women are resilient and strong. The results of this study reveal that Black women use adversity as fuel, thus helping them develop the necessary skills to prepare them for leadership. Their strength through adversity is driven by the resilience that has manifested as motivation factors such as family and relationships, mentorship and sponsorship, as well as the support of cultural identity and diversity. The current findings support the notion that adversity shapes Black women into leaders with an emphasis on higher education leadership.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00221678211003000

But while having a highly competitive culture is, on its face, gender-neutral, it actually worsens gender inequality.  That’s the key finding of our new study with colleague Ragan Petrie, published in the most recent issue of the ILR Review. As economists who study workplace diversity and career-family conflicts for women, we wanted to investigate how competition at work plays out in people’s lives. We couldn’t just compare people with more and less competitive jobs, because they differ in a lot of other ways as well. So we set up a few experiments.	https://theconversation.com/competitive-workplaces-dont-work-for-gender-equality-222689

They land better jobs and earn more. The researchers claim to be surprised by their findings, but is it really so remarkable? The association of senior positions with bullying and dominance behaviour will doubtless come as a shock to many.  This is not to suggest that all people with good jobs or who run organisations are bullies. Far from it. It’s not hard to think of good people in powerful positions. What this tells us is that we don’t need aggressive people to organise our lives for us. Neither good leadership, nor organisational success, nor innovation, insight or foresight, require a dominance mindset. In fact, all can be inhibited by someone throwing their weight around.	https://amp-theguardian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/30/playground-politics-bullies-competition

As part of the NDIS Review Recommendations participants who need 24/7 living supports would generally be funded at a 1:3 support ratio (one support worker for three participants). This essentially penalises people with disability who need high levels of support, of which I am one.  Shared supports would mean I do not have choice and control over: ❌ Who supports me ❌ Where I live ❌ Who I live with ❌ How I schedule my day  It means having no flexibility and keeping to a strict schedule for everything including eating, showering, toileting and going to or getting out of bed.  It puts us at risk medically, physically and psychologically. It equates to institutionalisation, directly contravenes Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and is purely a cost cutting exercise.

4/7/2024 9:24:54	Cam Newton, The Super Bowl, And Racist Stereotypes Against A Black Quarterback | Adam Ericksen	Newton’s response to the reporter was brilliant. After all, the racist stereotype was shattered 26 years ago! In 1990 Randall Cunningham threw for 30 touchdowns, 3,466 yards, and ran for 942 yards – which combined for an NFL record until 2006.  But racist stereotypes are hard to break. A white reporter demanding that a black quarterback answer for white stereotypes against black quarterbacks points to the power structures of racism in American culture. Black people must answer for racism? Really? #SideBySide	https://www.patheos.com/blogs/teachingnonviolentatonement/2016/02/cam-newton-the-super-bowl-and-racist-stereotypes-against-a-black-quarterback/

However, we cannot use our investment in a respectability politic which demands that Black women never show anger or emotion in the face of injustice to demand Serena’s silence. Resistance is often impolite, and frequently it demands that we skirt the rules.  Even so, when asked about her loss yesterday, Serena, while not remorseful about her exchange with the ref, was nothing but gracious to Sam Stosur on her win.  Moreover, the USTA loves angry heckling players—as long as they are white men. Early in the tournament, there was a video and interview tribute to Jimmy Connors, a player legendary for his angry outbursts on the court. In the tribute they devoted extended time to showing one of the more famous of these outbursts, in a celebratory manner. White anger is entertaining; Black anger must be contained. #SideBySide	https://www.crunkfeministcollective.com/2011/09/12/refereeing-serena-racism-anger-and-u-s-womens-tennis/

Our first paper from this project is currently under peer review.  Like Yolanda, our interviewees – whom we gave pseudonyms to protect their privacy – were almost all Black women over the age of 60 who lived in old buildings in neighborhoods that have borne the brunt of discrimination – such as redlining and inequitable land use decisions – and disinvestment.

The focus is on understanding how names and ethnic backgrounds influence hiring decisions in Australia, and the implications this has on diversity and equality in the workplace.  Applicants with English names received 26.8% of positive responses for leadership roles. Non-English names received 11.3%. Applicants with English names received 21.2% of positive responses for non-leadership positions, while non-English names received 11.6%.

Although research of skilled immigrant women has revealed important insights into how the intersection of gender, race, and class shape women's work experience, the White Anglo colonial male promotion practices inscribed on Australian organizations in relation to skilled immigration remain little researched in Australia. This article explores the differences between the career progressions of cisgender, highly skilled immigrant women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds employed in a variety of industries. It reveals how both Anglo White and non-Anglo White highly skilled immigrant women were affected by colonial patriarchal power relations, which served to hinder their career progression. However, the Whiteness of the top levels of the Australian capitalist colonial labor market benefitted the White Anglo group's vertical career growth.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12965

4/7/2024 21:24:42	Public service discrimination must be eliminated	In a recent analysis, economists Robert Breunig, David Hansell and Nu Nu Win studied promotion prospects across the Australian Public Service. Their data source is extraordinarily detailed, comprising essentially every public servant over a 20-year period, from 2001 to 2020. With more than 100,000 public servants each year, the dataset runs into millions of observations.  Although the data are de-identified, the researchers know whether each public servant is from an English-speaking background or a non-English-speaking background. Let’s call these categories Anglo and non-Anglo for simplicity.  Comparing people with the same level of experience, the researchers ask the question: who gets promoted? At every promotion point, they find that Anglo people had an edge. From APS4 to APS5 and APS5 to APS6, the gap was about one-tenth. From APS6 to EL1, Anglo applicants were one-quarter more likely to win promotion. From EL1 to EL2, Anglo applicants were around 50% more likely to get promoted. And from EL2 to SES, Anglo applicants were about 60% more likely to get promoted.	https://www.themandarin.com.au/220329-discrimination-must-be-eliminated-from-the-public-service/

Adopting Anglo names and discrimination - ScienceDirect	A field experiment and a lab experiment investigated how White Americans react to foreigners who present themselves either using original names or Anglo names. Drawing on self-categorization theory, hypotheses were derived from a partial ingroup membership framework. In Study 1, an email from a Chinese student requesting a meeting about graduate training was sent to 419 White professors with the name of the sender being varied (Xian versus Alex). Use of the Chinese name led to fewer responses and agreements to meet than using the Anglo name. In Study 2, a lecture recording from an international graduate student was presented to 185 White undergraduates with the name of the lecturer varied (Jian versus John). The preference for Anglo (Chinese) names over Chinese (Anglo) names was apparent among those high (low) in assimilationist and low (high) in multicultural ideologies. These findings point to an important interplay between partial intergroup membership and acculturation ideologies of perceivers in predicting bias. Future research directions from both minority and majority perspectives are discussed.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103116304620

Methods Data came from Speak Out Against Racism (SOAR), a cross-sectional study of 4664 public school students in grades 5–9 in two Australian states in 2017. An adaption of the Adolescent Discrimination Distress Index (ADDI), as a measure of discrimination, was used across four Indigenous and ethnic categories (Indigenous, Asian and non-Asian visible minorities, Anglo/European). Effect-measure modification (EMM) examined how experiences of racial discrimination across ethnic groups varied by gender, country of birth and religion.  Results A sizeable proportion (40%) of students reported experiencing racial discrimination. Indigenous, Asian and non-Asian visible minority students reported higher rates of experiencing racial discrimination than their Anglo-European peers. Male students reported higher rates of experiencing racial discrimination than female students. Foreign-born students reported experiencing racial discrimination more often than native-born students, and both Christian and religious minorities experienced racial discrimination more often than students identifying with the dominant “No religion” group.  Conclusions The findings highlight the prevalence of racial discrimination among adolescents and how gender, country of birth and religion can increase risk of these experiences.	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40615-021-01021-8

4/7/2024 21:29:23	The diffusion of diversity management: The case of France - ScienceDirect	Diversity, a ‘voluntary’ concern as seen through the Anglo-Saxon lens, and discrimination, a ‘legal’ mandated concern as seen through the same lens, have simultaneously been gaining popularity in France since 2003. In this respect, this country is undergoing a regulation process with various constituencies promoting new sets of rules to make French society more inclusive. Through three different explanatory lenses, I examine how published discourse regarding adoption of diversity practices is converted into action. These lenses, the Anglo-American business case, which insists on the economic rationality of such adoption, and neo-institutional theory, which views diversity management as a result of isomorphic change processes, is joined by French social regulation theory, which posits diversity management as part of a process of designing new rules. My data shows that mandated practices have higher adoption rates than voluntary practices, but there are important variations in terms of rates of adoption, within both voluntary and mandatory processes. Besides the perceived threats from not complying, French managers take into account levels of flexibility as well as implementation cost. In this sense, French organizational constituents mediate the various initiatives suggested to them by their environment and exert a form of autonomous regulation. Laws focus attention and trigger action, rather than constraining it.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956522109000979
4/7/2024 21:30:16	“I was made to feel very discriminated against as an anglo-saxon”: Grappling with pedagogies of change | Emerald Insight	Critical discussion of the social conditions that shape educational thinking and practice is now embedded in accredited teacher education programmes. Beneath beliefs that critique of educational inequality is desirable, however, lie more problematic questions around critical pedagogies, ethics and power. Emotional investments can work to protect habituated ways of thinking, despite attempts to move students beyond their comfort zone. This strategic process can shift attitudes and promote intellectual and emotional growth, but can also produce defensive reactions. This paper, a self-study in relation to an incident in a tertiary education programme, examines how student feedback on content and pedagogy positions teachers and learners. The purpose of this paper is to frame and reframe ways in which learner feedback to critical approaches might be read. The argument examines, through dialogue, the potential of disruptive teaching approaches for recontextualising both learner and teacher response. Such exploration articulates particular tensions and challenges inherent in critical teacher education pedagogies.  	https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/QRJ-01-2015-0008/full/html

While higher education remains a hostile work environment for senior academic women their participation rates are unlikely to increase. This article explores the barriers that senior academic women experience. It then examines whether or not diversity management programmes might provide a useful management tool to increase the participation of senior women in higher education. If diversity management can impact on the management culture, more senior women may remain in universities and thereby impact on that culture.	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13583883.2003.9967092

Central to this paper is the claim that legislative, constitutional, and other structural reforms are limited on their own to prevent institutional practices of violence and exclusion that are bound up with popular ways of imagining Indigenous and non-Indigenous identities. In light of the potential limitations of top-down reforms to prevent the perpetuation of discriminatory policymaking in relation to Australia's First Peoples, this paper explores the value of bottom-up initiatives that constructively engage the imaginative, affective, and reflective capacities of individuals to facilitate a ‘critical re-imagining’ (The Epistemology of Resistance: Gender and Racial Oppression, Epistemic Injustice, and Resistant Imaginations, Oxford University Press, 2013) of Indigenous Australians as social and political actors. Developing and supporting such initiatives, on this view, is integral to the wider task of promoting and protecting Indigenous rights, interests, and entitlements.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajs4.28

She describes the racial and cultural struggle between Navajos and Anglos and the manifestation of that struggle in schools and the workplace. While utilizing these theories' central insights, but then moves beyond them. While differences in culture play a role in the divisions between Anglos and Navajos, Deyhle asserts that these differences intertwine with power relations in the larger community, and that Navajo school success and failure are best understood as part of this process of racial conflict. Navajos, subjected to discrimination in the workplace and a vocationally centered assimilationist curriculum in schools, are more academically successful when they are more secure in their traditional culture. This study demonstrates that those students who embrace this life-affirming vision both gain a solid place in their society and are more successful in the Anglo world of the school.	https://meridian.allenpress.com/her/article-abstract/65/3/403/31648/Navajo-Youth-and-Anglo-Racism-Cultural-Integrity

Using institutional theory, this research fills a gap in existing scholarship by contributing to understanding the mechanisms by which organisations avoid addressing underrepresentation and enforce discriminatory practices in three significant ways. First, organisations may claim equality and assume that the organisation is characterised by a climate of inclusion as a way of ignoring issues of underrepresentation. Second, organisations utilise diversity management to improve the image of the organisation and engage in legitimising practices that contribute towards improving the brand. Third, organisations also engage in silencing practices by exercising internal control over employees, in this case players, and prohibiting them from participating in public debates about racial abuse. This study concludes that avoiding underrepresentation contributes to the continued exclusion of Indigenous Australians in leadership positions within the AFL, conceptualised here as a case of ‘discrimination by avoidance’.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/03128962231160654

Maznevski, 2008	We examined perceptions of managers from four Western European cultural groups about women's and men's leadership. Participants from every cultural group perceived reliable gender-based differences in leadership effectiveness. While some stereotypes varied across cultures, stereotyping patterns were more often linked to participants' gender than to their cultural beliefs. Unexpectedly, gender stereotypes of leaders were least prevalent among Latin respondents compared to those from more egalitarian cultures. In the Nordic and Anglo groups, male participants' stereotypes disparaged women's performance at the most valued leadership competencies. The implications for women's leadership advancement in these different cultural contexts are discussed.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1470595808091789

The present article suggests that there are limitations to applying this model to understanding bias toward other groups and proposes that a comprehensive view of the dynamics of the Anglos’ bias toward Latinos requires consideration of the distinctive elements of this form of intergroup relations. In four empirical studies, we experimentally document discrimination against Latinos (Study 1), explore the potential dimensions that underlie bias against Latinos (Study 2), and examine the effect of a particular social identity cue, accentedness, on perceptions of acceptance and belongingness of Latinos and members of other groups (Studies 3 and 4). These studies consider general processes of prejudice and identify how particular facets of bias against Latinos can shape their experiences and, taken together, illustrate how understanding bias against Latinos can reciprocally inform contemporary theories of prejudice.	https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2009.01633.x

On the basis of their right to self-determination, Indigenous Peoples have the right to participate fully, if they so choose, in the cultural and public life of the wider society and to maintain, protect and develop all manifestations of their cultures, including their sciences, technologies and traditional knowledge. They must be guaranteed free, prior and informed consent in any projects and decision-making that affect them.	https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/03/science-must-be-inclusive-and-not-exclusive-says-un-expert

The Migration Amendment (Evacuation to Safety) Bill calls for an end to the suffering for approximately 150 refugees and people seeking asylum who remain stuck in Nauru and PNG.  Some people have spent 10 years in Australia’s offshore detention system that is in clear breach of Australia’s obligations under the Refugee Convention.	https://www.amnesty.org.au/australias-double-standards-on-human-rights-is-keeping-refugees-and-people-seeking-asylum-on-the-brink-of-despair-in-nauru-and-png/

It is neither brief or necessary. Detention of refugees can last for weeks months or even years while their application makes its way through the bureaucracy. Australia is the only country in the developed world to imprison refugees. In other countries they are generally released into the community while their application is being processed. Refugees in detention centres are not informed of their rights to the UNHCR, refugee support groups or legal representatives. In fact the Government has gone to extraordinary lengths to isolate them from such groups.	https://refugeeaction.org/information/how-australia-violates-human-rights/

As human rights defenders turn the spotlight on Australia’s off-shore detention policies, the Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI)’s new dataset shows how poorly the country is performing in several areas of human rights.

The eight Torres Strait Islanders are indigenous inhabitants of Boigu, Poruma, Warraber and Masig, four small, low-lying islands in Australia. The decision represents a historical win for indigenous communities worldwide, who have the smallest ecological footprints, yet are significantly and disproportionally impacted by the adverse effects of climate change.	https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2022/09/27/u-n-human-rights-committee-finds-that-australia-is-violating-human-rights-obligations-towards-torres-strait-islanders-for-climate-inaction/

Let me try to explain. In the report, it mentions:  The Grants Work Group discussed whether approving funds for an event in a country with harsh LGBQTIA+ laws was appropriate.  This makes me pause and ask:  - are the Grants Work Group unbiased in when they decide when to enforce this? - are they applying this standard to other countries that aren’t in Africa? - how do they decide what is harsh enough and what is not?  So I’d like to look at anti-DEI laws in other non-African countries.	https://www.practicaldiversity.org/2024/04/08/my-response-to-the-psf-retrospective-on-the-djangocon-africa-grant-process/

One woman was told by doctors that swelling, pain and warmth in her leg was normal, despite warning the clinicians that she had a history of blood clots. Sutton-El urged her to visit the emergency room. Tests found the pregnant patient did indeed have a blood clot, a situation that can be deadly.  Some clients were told they weren’t doing enough to lose weight. After another client was treated dismissively when she paid for a visit in cash, Sutton-El posed as a patient and got the same response, making her wonder how many other Black women had been treated the same way.  “The biggest thing is that they’re not being listened to,” said Sutton-El, founder of Birth in Color, a nonprofit that offers doula services to expecting Virginians. Doulas support and advocate for pregnant patients. “They’re being dismissed or [clinicians] act as if the pain isn’t there, or act as if the issue is normal, when it’s not.”  As the United States contends with stark racial disparities in maternal health, experts are pushing states to mandate training for medical professionals to combat implicit bias, the prejudiced attitudes a person might hold without being aware of it. Lawmakers in more states are heeding that call.	https://stateline.org/2024/04/05/to-close-racial-gap-in-maternal-health-some-states-take-aim-at-implicit-bias/?emci=377e518c-bbf5-ee11-aaf0-7c1e52017038&emdi=7c4d30cf-d1f5-ee11-aaf0-7c1e52017038&ceid=29340

Medical professionals appear to be ignoring official guidelines into the disease – going so far as to section her under the Mental Health Act, and limiting her mother’s visiting rights.  There is a petition people can sign calling on the NHS to act. You can sign it here.  However, Millie’s situation is made all the worse when you realise that she is at least the third woman the NHS has treated like this in the last month alone. Moreover, across the health service there have been multiple cases of this nature in the past year.  It shows the NHS has a systemic problem when it comes to treating chronically ill people – and at times, it is little more than a threat to their lives.	https://www.thecanary.co/editorial/2024/02/24/severe-me-millie-lancaster/

Previous reports indicate that ethnic inequalities in health exist among older adults, but information is limited by the paucity of data from small minority ethnic groups. This study aimed to analyse inequalities in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and five determinants of health in older adults across all ethnic groups in England.  We found evidence of wide ethnic inequalities in HRQoL and five determinants of health for older adults in England. Outcomes varied between minority ethnic groups, highlighting heterogeneity in the direction and magnitude of associations. We recommend further research to understand the drivers of inequalities, together with policy changes to improve equity of socioeconomic opportunity and access to services for older adults from minority ethnic groups.	https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30287-5/fulltext

The Executive Summary of the report is attached below.	https://www.afdo.org.au/the-economic-benefits-of-the-national-disability-insurance-scheme-and-the-consequences-of-government-cost-cutting/
4/10/2024 14:41:15	Pluralistic: 27 Jan 2022 – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow	Today, the capital markets are utterly uncoupled from the real economy. The stock market's unprecedented bull run coincided with a decline in the fortunes of real businesses and real workers, and the overslosh produced bubbles in other asset classes, including some absolutely absurd ones (cryptos/NFTs, wine, art, supercars, sports collectibles, etc).  The rich have too much money, and nowhere to put it and so the economy is in metastatic, stage-four ponzi-ism.  Many asset bubbles are indirectly harmful – e.g. the climate consequences of crypto, or the way easy capital has spurred even more mergers and monopolization, with the attendant layoffs and worsening labor conditions. Asset inflation has also spurred investment in predatory enterprises like Uber and Doordash, who use investor cash to subsidize a money-losing operation that strangles real, locally owned businesses.  But there's one asset bubble that has an immediate and direct harmful effect: the housing bubble. Since the Great Financial Crisis, Wall Street has been hell-bent on acquiring single-family homes, converting them to rental property, gouging on rent, skimping on maintenance, and evicting on the flimsiest pretense.	https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/27/extraordinary-popular-delusions/#wall-street-slumlords

We are working with partners @many_mansions and @hopeofthevalley on a sped-up construction schedule, and hope to open this facility by year end.  Our police, social-service providers, and homeless advocates all agree that by far the best way to address homelessness is with housing and services together.

The bitter irony? This latest invitation arrived just three months after I received the “Emerging Leader” award from the American Academy of Medical Colleges’ Group on Women in Medicine and Science, a national recognition for a leadership initiative that I was already applying in my role as the founder of a DEI group for an International Medical Educator Association (IAMSE).  Although I understood that the intent of the email was to encourage and support my career aspirations, and I appreciated that even seasoned leaders can improve their skills, here was the unintended message:  I—the sole female faculty in my department—certainly must need to work on my leadership skill set. My male colleagues do not.	https://hbsp.harvard.edu/inspiring-minds/where-womens-leadership-development-programs-fall-short

Specifically they looked at whether different equity strategies made a difference to the gendered composition of the network elite - the people who are most “central” to the industry. Men are grossly over-represented in this network elite and enjoy the greatest access to social capital and exert a disproportionate level of influence (compared to their numbers) in the film industries we studied. Deb’s team tested different hypothetical “policies’ to see if these improved access to elite network positions for women and gender minorities (WGM).	https://www.linkedin.com/posts/doris-ruth-eikhof-1942b889_gender-equity-screen-activity-7183371208288014336-FzzN/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android

When a researcher “wins the lottery” and gets a (pretty small) grant to explore a new idea, universities groan: they see a penalty, not an opportunity. They have to replace that researcher’s teaching duties and pay for additional administration. The Report recommends that ARC grants move towards funding these “indirect” costs of research.  Awesome!

Classism is embedded in the tech industry, everywhere.   From requiring expensive certifications or expensive degrees to even get an entry-level job, to expecting everyone to have a home lab and hardware capable of running any OS and software for hiring tests, to expensive conferences and events tickets where people who can afford it do the real networking to find work, and the others are left behind.   It feels like an elaborate system extended at every step to gatekeep the field from the poors. Not that this doesn’t exist in other industries of course, but it is worse in tech. Way worse. A lot of people don't realize how bad this is.  If the tech industry wants to keep believing it is a meritocracy,  this needs to be fixed.	https://disabled.social/@Em0nM4stodon@infosec.exchange/112011353289341553

The watershed study found that applicants with names suggesting they were white got 50% more callbacks from employers than those whose names indicated they were Black.  Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Chicago recently took that premise and expanded on it, filing 83,000 fake job applications for 11,000 entry-level positions at a variety of Fortune 500 companies.  Their working paper, published this month and titled "A Discrimination Report Card," found that the typical employer called back the presumably white applicants around 9% more than Black ones. That number rose to roughly 24% for the worst offenders.	https://www.opb.org/article/2024/04/11/white-sounding-names-get-called-back-for-jobs-more-than-black-ones-a-new-study-finds/

I am a highly qualified candidate and was treated with disdain, fear, insecurity, disrespect. I secured a job this week and never ever would I want to undergo a job search ever again. I don't care how bad I am treated, I don't care I would not ever put myself through a job search like I went through.  I have 10 years to retirement and honestly, I cannot wait to retire and get out of this h-llhole of the world of work. I will likely exist rather than thrive for the next ten years and yes that is sad, but I have been so burned and humiliated by the past few months, I would rather stick with what I have got than move again.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pybW2zRyOlY

Orania occupies a strange position in the country – despite regularly being viewed as an attempt to revive or preserve the poisonous ideas underpinning apartheid, it is largely ignored by the South African authorities. As Adepitan speaks to local people, visits a school (where he watches an excruciating play) and gets kicked out of the community’s largest Afrikaner Protestant church, he asks the necessary but uncomfortable questions – and the hostility becomes increasingly palpable. 	https://amp.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/mar/18/tv-tonight-what-happened-when-a-black-broadcaster-visited-a-whites-only-town-in-south-africa

His point was that racism is something racially marginalized people experience regardless of gender. And he's right. But here's where this logic falls short:  Women of color endure racism AND sexism. Men of color experience the former, white women the latter. Contrary to popular belief, white men experience neither, despite the never-ending whining from anti-wokesters.  As an anti-racist and DEI practitioner, I often see white women bemoan Black and other racially led feminist posts, saying stuff like "all women are oppressed, why are you dividing us?" I've also seen men of color ask why bring up Black, Latina, Asian, etc feminism in anti-racist posts.

However, if they were more honest in their messaging -- e.g., "I think that black and queer people should have to put up with constant harassment and anyone who proactively subverts that harassment with proactive moderation is Acting Like an HOA Actually" -- then they would provoke opposition, because the comparison is ludicrous.

In the 1960s, when many major American cities began electing Black mayors for the first time, expectations had been high. However, it became clear that these leaders faced increasingly intractable problems: As white residents fled to the suburbs, they took with them the wealth, tax base, and social capital that their communities needed to make progress. Political scientists coined the term “the Hollow Prize” for this doomed leadership.	https://ssir.org/articles/entry/nonprofit-leadership-challenges-BIPOC-leaders#

The stereotype of Los Alamos is that everyone is a scientist, everyone is wealthy, and everyone lives in a million-dollar house. That’s not the reality for many in this town. Some residents are holding on to their housing by the skin of their teeth — others, like Shibli, not at all.  “It’s OK, as long as I can stay warm,” he says. “I have a heater.

The effects were so large that the recession effectively provided 4% of all 55-year-olds with an extra year of life. And in states that saw big jumps in unemployment, people were more likely to report being in excellent health. Recessions, it would seem, help us stay fitter, and live longer.  So what could the explanation be? How does higher unemployment lead to longer life?  The answer was pollution. Counties that experienced the biggest job losses in the Great Recession, the economists found, also saw the largest declines in air pollution, as measured by levels of the fine particulate matter PM2.5. It makes sense: During recessions, fewer people drive to work. Factories and offices slow down, and people cut back on their own energy use to save money. All that reduced activity leads to cleaner air.	https://www.businessinsider.com/recessions-mortality-degrowth-economy-gdp-unemployment-environment-pollution-2024-3

I keep hearing mental illness is the key factor behind multiple innocent women, Women of Colour and People of Colour being killed over the weekend.  Sure its a factor, but this incident cannot be blamed on the behaviour of one individual actor, framed as the EXCEPTION.  For the perpetrator to feel they could murder multiple women, WoC and PoC in broad daylight - its because this behaviour is part of a culture that is the NORM.  It was no coincidence that women, WoC and PoC faced the brunt - merely another symptom, another consequence of a harmful system going unchecked.  Blaming it on mental illness makes it easy to wash our hands off the incident.  Getting to the root of the problem, targeting the systems, behaviours and culture that must first exist in order for this to have happened - much harder.  But its what must, collectively, be done.  #sexualviolence #racialviolence #patriarchy  The Creative Co-Operative Maya Cares	https://www.linkedin.com/posts/priyanka-ashraf_sexualviolence-racialviolence-patriarchy-activity-7185408895966744576-Dcac/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android

Whenever a tragic event occurs, like domestic violence or a crime, there is a concern on the perpetrator's ethnic background. This concern is steeped from the awareness of pervasive stereotypes that burdens entire communities, creating a constant need refute or overcompensate to avoid these misconceptions.  Racial privilege goes beyond the comfort of access to resources and power. It's also about how people are perceived based on their ethnic backgrounds or race. Unfortunately, not everyone is afforded the privilege of exploring our multifaceted selves.  Another reminder that we exist beyond our racialised identities.

4/16/2024 6:47:26	Officer-Involved Domestic Violence	Individuals who are the victims of domestic violence at the hands of police officer-batterers are often in a unique and particularly vulnerable situation. Unlike most victims of domestic violence, where the success of protective efforts depends on the cooperation of law enforcement, those subject to officer-involved domestic violence (OIDV) may, for a variety of reasons, be unable to secure the assistance they seek. This is particularly troublesome in light of increased rates of domestic violence in police officer families. Some studies have indicated that women in around 40% of police officer families experience domestic violence.[1] In light of this alarming statistic, it is important to note a lack of recent research on OIDV. However, this is not a reason to entirely discount high rates if OIDV reported by earlier studies. Discussing this issue, one author noted:  The data on intimate partner abuse by police officers are both dated and potentially flawed, but in ways that make it more likely that abuse is being under—rather than over—reported. Most of the studies rely on self-reporting by police officers to establish prevalence of abuse. Self-reporting is a notoriously unreliable measure; as one study noted, ‘The issue of the reliability of self-reports data is problematic when considering any socially undesirable behavior.’[2]	https://www.stopvaw.org/officer-involved_domestic_violence
4/16/2024 6:48:20	Black and Blue Bloods: Protecting Police Officer Families from Domestic Violence	Officer-involved domestic violence (OIDV) is a national problem, with police officer families having higher rates of domestic violence than non–police officer families. OIDV is also an underresearched problem with few studies or proposed solutions.  Many victims of OIDV do not report their abuse precisely because their abuser is a police officer, whom they fear is in a unique position to protect him/herself from any legal consequences. Often, OIDV complaints are not investigated properly in a nonbiased manner. While a handful of police agencies around the country have developed specific policies and procedures to deal with OIDV, Washington State has enacted legislation that requires its police agencies to adopt OIDV-specific policies.  The International Associations of Chiefs of Police (IACP), an organization that addresses various issues confronting law enforcement, has also developed a model policy on OIDV. This Note proposes that, in light of the Washington legislation and the model policy proposed by the IACP, each state should enact a statute that requires its police agencies to develop policies on OIDV. This Note also outlines a specific set of procedures that such statutes should, at a minimum, require its police agencies to adopt, ranging from educating police officers on domestic violence to developing guidelines on responding to and investigating OIDV complaints	https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=hofstra_law_student_works

The latter studies are now close to 30 years old, but experts are not optimistic much has changed. Departments are loathe to portray themselves in a negative light by acknowledging this abuse, and a code of silence prevents officers from speaking out against their colleagues and punishes those that do.	https://dylantaylorlehman.medium.com/officer-involved-domestic-violence-an-omnipresent-but-underreported-phenomenon-that-needs-to-be-e899e576f747
4/16/2024 6:49:33	"Officer-Involved Domestic Violence" by Isaac Baron	Domestic and family violence has been a critical issue in contemporary society. Efforts have been made in researching the causes, effects, and mediating factors of domestic violence in relation to the workplace. Studies demonstrate that a relationship between conflict crossing over from the work to the home environment exist. Additional studies demonstrate that domestic violence does affect the workplace; however, there is little to no scientific data on the reverse relationship. The reverse relationship regards whether the workplace affects the occurrence of domestic violence. This research paper will dive into this topic, and on the lack of data available. Supporting data will illustrate that factors from the workplace do affect the likelihood of domestic and/or family violence occurring in police families. Not considering or viewing police family violence as an effect of workplace factors is shortsighted, and it demonstrates the need for education on this topic. With new data, comes new policies and implications that are reconfigurations of the existing policies. There is a need to bring this subject to light, and in view of the law enforcement community.	https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/themis/vol6/iss1/9/

4/18/2024 18:13:09	A must-read article on Justice Lee's reasoning in the Lehrmann v Network Ten case by Dr Rachael Burgin Dr Rachael Burgin and Saxon Mullins.	The article looks at how the defense relied on outdated stereotypes about rape. These rape myths are false assumptions about sexual violence. They “continue to be raised in rape trials, police investigations, the media and homes across Australia”: - Consent: Justice Lee clarifies that due to the victim’s level of intoxication she was unable to consent. - Victims fighting back: Victim-Survivors can react in various ways, and freezing is a common response. - Only strangers commit rape: most rapes are in fact perpetrated by someone the Victim-Survivor knows. - Silence or delayed reporting equals lying: Victim-Survivors can exhibit "counterintuitive behaviour" after an assault , but it doesn't negate the truth of their experience. - the Perfect victim: is an impossible archetype to meet.   Justice Lee's decision shows that rape myths are false assumptions that silence victims. The decision has the potential to change how Australian courts handle cases of sexual assault and inspire reforms that ensure Victim-Survivors are treated more fairly.

4/18/2024 18:13:41	Trigger warning: Death of an Aboriginal person with disability.	Just announced this morning: $1.8 million civil penalty applied by the Federal Court of Australia over the breaches of the NDIS Practice Standards and Code of Conduct that led to the death of Kyah Lucas. RIP Kyah. The Orders are the first thing published on the Court’s website: the reasons for decision will be uploaded here as soon as I can access them on the Federal Court’s website. Every provider should read the decision and Statement of Agreed Facts as this tragic case is rich in lessons for providers. My approach in analysing cases always starts from a position of humility. This case raises issues around risk planning, daily shift plans, physical controls, the need for training to reflect individual needs, the need for reviews of risk planning when new service types are added, the need for a second ‘set of eyes’ regarding plans and training, and competency assessment. 	https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alan-hough-35a2922_order-of-the-federal-court-of-australia-ugcPost-7186148624345563137-Qquc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android

4/18/2024 20:23:06	I came across a video on TikTok by @nursebblay about how she took her 7-year-old daughter to the pediatrician because she was showing early signs of puberty.	The doctor mentioned that had the patient been White, she would have recommended additional testing. But stated that because she was Black, and Black & Latina girls go into puberty early, that nothing needed to be done.  In 1997, the Pediatric Endocrine Society first recommended new race-based criteria for defining precocious puberty based research papers that showed earlier onset of puberty in Black girls. It said that breast development should only be considered precocious in Black girls younger than 6 years but White girls younger than 7. The guidelines weren’t formally accepted, yet race has become widely accepted as a factor in puberty timing of girls.  It wasn’t until after this Mom demanded for additional labs, that her daughter’s results eventually came back abnormal and a further work-up was started.  I hope this story highlights how race-based assumptions in healthcare can lead to overlooked diagnoses. When we use race as a proxy for other factors, we overlook problems that could be occurring. Let’s continue challenging racial biases in medicine for better care for all. #joelbervell #racialbiasinmedicine #medicalmythbuster #healthcareonlinkedin	https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joelbervell_joelbervell-racialbiasinmedicine-medicalmythbuster-ugcPost-7183484139071832064-glEp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

They may even get wrong treatments prescribed, that can worsen their condition. The necessary financial assistance and health aid does not get approved. Many sufferers don't have the strength to fight with authorities.  You might think before a virus everyone is the same. But not even the risk of infection is evenly distributed: Cramped living conditions, poverty and jobs with lots of human contact all increase the risk. Every single infection harbors the risk of getting Long Covid. Plus the probability of contracting Long Covid is not evenly distributed: Women are affected about twice as often as men.

In the essay, Miserando describes her experience with chronic illness, using a handful of spoons as a metaphor for units of energy available to perform everyday actions. The metaphor has since been used to describe a wide range of disabilities, mental health issues, forms of marginalization, and other factors that might place unseen burdens on individuals.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory

The other was 15-year-old Cassius, who police believe was assaulted with a metal pole.

I often say when we review market research, and this could be to support whether salaries are in line with the majority, or not - qualifications/requirements for potential positions; there is always a biase. The standard had to be decided on in order to create the comparatives in the first place. That is what we're up against. And whether it's intentional or not, it comes out of a system that originally wasn't meant for us - with a generation that had many who stood by those decisions as well.

Things changed prolly around the 60's/70s (I had a conversation with the pastor of a hidden Black baptist church right around the corner from me.) Black families moved in and for a while their presence was substantial in Rockridge.   But no more. It's now a lesser Piedmont. Very white, very affluent.  And when I'm out and about *I make SURE* everyone can see that I'm a neighbor. I make a *point* of signaling that I live here: from how/where I walk my dog, shopping locally, being seen by the regulars.  It's exhausting and necessary, navigating these majority White spaces.

For example, we all know that the reply guy phenomenon is a big problem on the Fediverse that creates a barrier to entry for women and other marginalized peoples. Appealing to the unwritten social code doesn’t fix this. Reply guys still do their reply guy schtick anyway.  Software code won’t totally fix this either, but it could help big time – and it’s more effective than trying to enforce an unwritten social code.	https://disabled.social/@atomicpoet@atomicpoet.org/111933467649462977

Her death could not be directly linked to her bashing, hence the lesser charges. The man has been sentenced to four years in jail after punching his young girlfriend 40 times in the head.  While much of the recent focus has been on the deaths of white women, there is an ongoing crisis across the country including the much higher proportionate incidence of FDV for Aboriginal women, and the consequent vital need for culturally appropriate support services for both women and men, and particularly funding for support and legal services for women, and inclusive, culturally appropriate men’s behaviour change and healing programs.  hashtag#justicesystem hashtag#FDV hashtag#Aboriginalissues hashtag#deathsofwomen hashtag#men hashtag#women	https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7192010186494992384/

After explaining every detail of the uncomfortable recollections of near death experiences, and showing evidence of photos of my bruised and bleeding face (sorry I am not comfortable to share these traumatising photos on social media) I was told 2 things:  - that I accept the AVO without question or fear (as I was scared the AVO might cause the ex partner to go over the edge and end up killing me) and that if I don't then I may not be able to work in the office anymore because the MP couldn't have someone 'being abused and not acting on it, working for him' whilst he was a white ribbon ambassador; and that  - I should tell everyone what was happening including showing everyone photos of my bruised and bleeding face because it would be 'good for my political career' including getting the sympathy vote (as I was also a councillor at the time)	https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7191933574021804032/

5/4/2024 14:52:15	Post | LinkedIn	I was notified today that I now join the list of Black professors at Texas A&M University who have been targeted by the Texas Scorecard, a conservative news outlet that have weaponized the open records laws against the likes of Dr. Kathleen McElroy and Dr. Arica Brandford. In my case, the Texas Scorecard have filed an open record request for my employment file, course syllabi, and email communications.   They are more than welcome to contact me directly and I will consider personally providing them with the documents that I have. I am completely open to the accurate reporting of every email I have written, and documents produced by University Presidents, Deans, Faculty Administrators, and Department Heads with respect to my support of DEI and fight against racial discrimination.   In addition, I challenge them to obtain the university grievance committee (UGC) final report (delivered to the Dean of Faculties on or about March 27, 2020) that addressed my concerns about the discriminatory practices in my department. To this very day, Texas A&M has refused to provide it to me despite my repeated requests. I encourage the Texas Scorecard to obtain it.   In the meantime, I will continue to speak out against workplace discrimination and hostile workplace environments in academia. 	https://www.linkedin.com/posts/leonard-bright-999963292_i-was-notified-today-that-i-now-join-the-activity-7192318817136529408-TV-e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

As we are sure the Board will agree, creating trust is a key component to building a healthy community. Over the past few years, the community has observed a slow decline of the trust between GDIHQ and Chapter Leaders. This is due to several sudden policy shifts, along with the failure to address several issues around race and inclusivity at both the Chapter and HQ level. This loss of trust has caused Chapter Leaders to resign, chapters to shut down and difficulty in keeping/recruiting new Leaders. Here are some specific examples:	https://an-open-letter-to-gdi-board.com/

In 2022 at the Gap State High School in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, for the first time in the history of a STEM subject offered at the high school, a large number of young females choose to study this STEM subject. The authors took this opportunity to run a unique study that tried to under- stand the influences on this decision. We ran a structured survey with Likert scale or Yes/No responses on an anonymised group of survey participants to better understand the influences behind their choices to study STEM in year 9. Most studies in this field ask young females why they did not choose a STEM subject but this study provides one of few studies surveying high school students at an early point in their school journey (instead of during college) finding out why they did choose the STEM subject. The results from the survey are then compared against policy choices showing there is disagreement between some chosen policy decisions and the recommen- dations here. The recommendations from the data presented here also provide schools with a practical and useful framework to support young females in choosing STEM subjects	https://search.informit.org/doi/10.3316/informit.T2024031600016201174722318

Fifteen percent of officers will abuse their authority at every opportunity. The remaining 70 percent could go either way depending on whom they are working with.  That’s a theory from my friend K.L. Williams, who has trained thousands of officers around the country in use of force. Based on what I experienced as a black man serving in the St. Louis Police Department for five years, I agree with him. 	https://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8661977/race-police-officer

On top of this, during the height of Australia’s blistering summer heat between December and February, Anna’s abuser refused her air conditioning. Like many living with ME/CFS, Anna experiences autonomic dysfunction – known as dysautonomia – which can affect blood pressure, heart rate, digestion, and body temperature. So, as Melbourne’s temperatures soared, Anna was left to suffer the impacts this had on her already horrendous health.	https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-analysis/2024/05/03/me-cfs-anna-australia/

One friend in particular could not understand why I was so mad. I explained to him it was because as a Black man, if I scare a white woman or make a white law enforcement officer nervous, that could be my life.

5/8/2024 6:04:41	(PDF) Australian Media, Intersectionality, and Reporting on Violence against Women from Diverse Backgrounds	The media’s representation of VAW greatly influences government policy and service response to victims from diverse backgrounds. A number of organizations supporting women fleeing from domestic violence or reporting sexual abuse have issued guidelines for the media to report on VAW with increased sensitivity and fewer stereotypes and victim-blaming (Fileborn et al., 2019). “Media reporting is considered an important indicator of community attitudes and beliefs about VAW and thus a critical site through which to measure progress toward shifting social norms that reinforce or exacerbate it” (Sutherland et al., 2019). Following the revitalization of #MeToo 2.0 in October 2017 in the United States, which created a cyberspace for the outpouring of stories of sexual harassment and abuse of women around the world, including Australia, there has been increased awareness of the extent and effect of VAW. However, scholars have noted that a lack of cultural diversity in the Australian newsrooms affects which news events or issues are covered and how they are reported by these newsrooms (Arvanitakis et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2021). This chapter presents results from a study that examines the media’s reporting of VAW from diverse cultural backgrounds and First Nations Australians. The study includes a content analysis of news articles published over a period of four months in 2020 when communities were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The research considers the types of news stories covered, sources used, the tone used in reporting these stories, and the background of the journalists who reported on these stories, which include culturally diverse and First Nations Australians. The chapter argues that using an intersectional lens when reporting about domestic and sexual violence is necessary to uncover the complex and systematic prejudices related to factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, class, ability, and gender (Crenshaw, 1989). The chapter concludes by noting that diversity in the newsroom is yet another area that needs attention so that news stories about VAW from culturally diverse and First Nations backgrounds are reported from an intersectional lens.	https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363392070_Australian_Media_Intersectionality_and_Reporting_on_Violence_against_Women_from_Diverse_Backgrounds#fullTextFileContent
5/8/2024 6:05:07	Australian Media, Intersectionality, and Reporting on Violence against	Recent research has noted how a lack of cultural diversity in the newsroom has an impact on what makes news and how it is reported (Rodrigues et al., 2021). This study examines how the media reports on violence against Australian women from culturally diverse backgrounds, and First Nations people. A qualitative analysis of news articles published in three prominent news media from September and December 2020 finds a lack of consideration given to intersectional factors, such as cultural diversity, race, socioeconomic conditions, and gender, that affect victims from diverse backgrounds. In a sign of positive development, following the #MeToo 2.0 movement of 2017 and Australian women groups’ efforts to change the narrative around violence against women (VAW), a significant number of news stories (23%) on VAW were reported in a constructive tone. However, the study finds that most of the journalists who reported on VAW that involved minority communities were either from Anglo-Celtic backgrounds (69%) or remained anonymous (5%). This raises concerns about journalists’ knowledge gap when reporting on the issue and cases of VAW from diverse communities. The chapter concludes by noting that diversity in the newsroom is yet another area that needs attention for a more nuanced coverage of stories of VAW.	https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003220411-13/australian-media-intersectionality-reporting-violence-women-diverse-backgrounds-usha-manchanda-rodrigues

This obsession with white acceptance prevents the race as a whole from doing what is necessary to completely free themselves from oppression. To this point, Dr. Amos Wilson said the white man’s “so called power is based on the nature of the relationship he has with the black man.”	https://atlantablackstar.com/2015/10/08/8-interesting-reasons-why-black-people-should-stop-expecting-white-america-to-wake-up-to-racism/

The impending decision in the case of Darren Wilson, the officer in Ferguson who shot Michael Brown, a black teenager, to death in August, was spurring mass protests against police brutality. The protests against police brutality were met with more police brutality, as officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at grieving crowds. As St. Louis spent an anxious autumn awaiting the decision, tanks began to appear at everyday places like malls, and soldiers patrolled boarded up shops. Mundane life became militarized. St. Louis residents, black and white, braced themselves for what was to come when justice was inevitably denied.	https://thecorrespondent.com/4936/what-i-had-to-tell-my-daughter-about-the-america-of-her-black-classmates/1396148177512-d5332d71

The paper draws on submissions to the 2018 Australian Senate Parliamentary Inquiry into Adoption Reform from Aboriginal community controlled organizations and highlights four common themes evident throughout these submissions: (i) the role of intergenerational trauma in high rates of Aboriginal child removal; (ii) the place of children within Aboriginal culture, kinship and identity; (iii) the centrality of the principles of self-determination and autonomy for Aboriginal communities and (iv) Aboriginal community controlled alternatives to child removal. Acknowledging the failure of both federal and state reforms to address the issues raised in these submissions, the paper reflects on the marginalization of Aboriginal voices and solutions within contemporary efforts to address the multiple crises of the child protection system and the implications for the future of Aboriginal children.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cfs.12865

He was literally a victim of racial profiling, because from the windshield he just looked darker.  He said after about the third time it was infuriating.

However, well into the 20th century, international research and clinical care remain rife with paternalism, extractive practices, and racist ideation, with race presumed to explain vulnerability or protection from various diseases, despite scientific evidence for far more precise mechanisms for infectious disease. We highlight experiences in global research on health and illness among indigenous populations in LMICs, seeking to clarify what is both scientifically essential and ethically desirable in research with human subjects; we apply a critical view towards race and racism as historically distorting elements that must be acknowledged and overcome.

5/16/2024 16:29:52	Our past creates our present: a brief overview of racism and colonialism in Western paleontology | Paleobiology | Cambridge Core	As practitioners of a historical science, paleontologists and geoscientists are well versed in the idea that the ability to understand and to anticipate the future relies upon our collective knowledge of the past. Despite this understanding, the fundamental role that the history of paleontology and the geosciences plays in shaping the structure and culture of our disciplines is seldom recognized and therefore not acted upon sufficiently. Here, we present a brief review of the history of paleontology and geology in Western countries, with a particular focus on North America since the 1800s. Western paleontology and geology are intertwined with systematic practices of exclusion, oppression, and erasure that arose from their direct participation in the extraction of geological and biological resources at the expense of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Our collective failure to acknowledge this history hinders our ability to address these issues meaningfully and systemically in present-day educational, academic, and professional settings. By discussing these issues and suggesting some ways forward, we intend to promote a deeper reflection upon our collective history and a broader conversation surrounding racism, colonialism, and exclusion within our scientific communities. Ultimately, it is necessary to listen to members of the communities most impacted by these issues to create actionable steps forward while holding ourselves accountable for the past.	https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/article/our-past-creates-our-present-a-brief-overview-of-racism-and-colonialism-in-western-paleontology/79248D87425C01E9D388DA2EFED92866

Grounded on a long-term ethnography conducted within Afro-Belgian anti-racist circles (2011–2019), the article argues that activist resistances, whether or not they give rise to political claims, have something to do with the colonial engagement of sociology and more generally of science. Building on postcolonial/black/feminist studies and decolonial indigenous research, the article explores to what extent, academic politics of citation and compensation of anti-racist activists could then be considered as decolonial interventions. Against the background of research involving groups whose activism is intrinsically linked to a political and epistemic domination, the paradigm of ‘protection’ of the ‘researched’ (through procedures of anonymization) is not only insufficient but problematic. Decolonial intervention should not only be addressed under the lens of knowledge co-production (participative/decolonial/anti-racist research) but also in terms of co-ownership policies of data/knowledges.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00113921221105914

Looking at recent research, I argue that work critical of extractive dynamics can give rise to a ‘double-helix of data extraction’ that exacerbates existing asymmetries by appropriating the means of critique of affected populations. I show how this dynamic might play out in practice by turning to my research on astronomy data in Chile, which adopted a decolonial lens and involved Indigenous activists. Finally, a radical embracement of reflexivity attentive to both positionality and political economy is advocated as a condition for conducting properly critical data studies (CDS), especially in the case of research relying on decolonial approaches. Although reflexivity cannot solve the double helix, it can expose the conditions underpinning research and acknowledge the limitations of research on its own.	https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-double-helix-of-data-extraction-radicalising-reflexivity-in-c

5/17/2024 6:41:16	How America Got Hooked On Useless Corporate Consulting - YouTube	As someone who works for a (European) management consulting firm, I can absolutely confirm your point on 11:21 that far too many people in executive functions have absolutely no idea how to do their job either. Getting to the upper echelons of large businesses typically requires only a minor level of competence, but a lot of skill in networking and socializing (or just having the right connections from family to begin with). These people then often look to consultants to either get some "objective research" to back up decisions they already wanted to make anyway, or to make the decision for them. #Leadership	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu6x6dy7oKA
5/17/2024 6:43:37	How America Got Hooked On Useless Corporate Consulting - YouTube	The amount of bullshit jobs in big companies always blows my mind. I worked for a subsidiary of major US healthcare insurer. Honestly 1/4 of the people on any team I joined just sat and watched movies all day, and just pretended to work. The other 3/4 would work, but mostly to keep busy: all the projects just ended up getting cancelled at the end of the year during a "re-org", where senior leadership would shuffle around and everyone congratulated everyone else on a job well done. Absolutely surreal place.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu6x6dy7oKA
5/17/2024 6:44:12	How America Got Hooked On Useless Corporate Consulting - YouTube	I think it’s worth noting that it’s really hard for consultants to present meaningful recommendations to executives as really good recommendations tend to be counter-intuitive. Why are they counter intuitive? Because if they were intuitive, the company would already be doing that. But that’s not what executives are often looking for. More often than not, they want to feed their confirmation bias and paying someone a lot of money to tell them they’re right is a lot more satisfying.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu6x6dy7oKA

I was reminded of him by your point of covering your ass. He said that was basically his job. Because he was an outsider that left after a few months, he could tell things that would normally destroy relationships within the company. Both from the directors to the employees and the other way around. He claimed it was very valuable as there were usually no internal structures to say or do the things that were necessary for the government agencies that hired him.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu6x6dy7oKA
5/17/2024 6:48:34	(30) How America Got Hooked On Useless Corporate Consulting - YouTube	I work for a Japanese IT company. One day they hired this guy on his early 50s, with a juicy salary, gave him a big position with a say over any decision from any team even though he just came out of nowhere, he’s not even a programmer nor does he seem to have any technical expertise. All he does is to say some platitudes or super obvious remarks after each meeting. Then after he says something, the managers who hired him and the CEO  are just like “this guy is a genius!” even though he might have said the most empty basic remark like “we need to work harder”, “we need to be more aggressive in this competitive market”. Maybe he’s doing some things behind curtains that are justifying his salary, but I just can’t see it.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu6x6dy7oKA
5/17/2024 6:50:05	How America Got Hooked On Useless Corporate Consulting - YouTube	I am a consultant and have been for a very long time. This is totally accurate, especially number two. What they're not mentioning is why do executives hire consultants. It's because the executive does not want anybody else inside the company to realize they don't know how to do their job. So they hire somebody. And most of what the consulting agency provides is the ability to say that they know what they're doing	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu6x6dy7oKA

From the weaponizing of Tema Okun’s tenets of White supremacy culture2 to being chronically underresourced and expected to single-handedly solve the problems caused by decades of racism, capitalism, and other isms—Black women have been bearing much of the load from a myriad of directions: lack of funder and board support,3 challenging organizational and staff dynamics,4 extractive expectations of the nonprofit sector at large.	https://nonprofitquarterly.org/it-isnt-just-lonely-at-the-top-its-downright-scary-the-reckoning-needed-for-black-women-leaders/?utm_content=293505584&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-542508

Over half showed people were admitted against their will - ABC News	Picture two people, both suffering from a serious mental illness requiring hospital admission. One was born in Australia, the other in Asia.  Hopefully, both could be treated on a voluntary basis, taking into account their individual needs, preferences and capacity to consent. If not, you might imagine they should be equally likely to receive treatment against their will (known colloquially as being "sectioned" or "scheduled").  However, our research published in British Journal of Psychiatry Open suggests this is not the case.  In the largest study globally of its kind, we found Australians are more likely to be treated in hospital for their acute mental illness against their will if they are born overseas, speak a language other than English, or are unemployed.	https://amp-abc-net-au.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/103829936

It started with an investigation into racist policing, and featured episodes such as Racebusters, which documented everyday racial harassment in Britain. The show was groundbreaking, and stands as a magnificent record not only of recent multicultural life in Britain, but also of the emergent discourses around race that have now entered mainstream consciousness.

The genocide unfolding upon Palestinian people—primarily but not exclusively in Gaza—has spurred public outrage around the world. Across all continents, ordinary people, students, workers, human rights movements (and even some governments) are mobilized to protest and act, demanding an immediate ceasefire and justice.  The disability rights community cannot continue to be silent, pretending that this is not happening. The moment calls for leadership, initiative, and action by all its sectors; from the grassroots to regional and international organizations, as well as those tasked with UN mandates to ensure that the rights of people with disabilities are respected. Public statements are not enough.  After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, our community mobilized to advocate for people with disabilities in Ukraine and demanded that those responsible for crimes be held accountable. Today, as Palestinians with disabilities struggle to survive this horrific genocide, we expect the same commitment. Anything less is unacceptable.

	studentactivism	Lewis had written that "For the first time in one hundred years this nation is being awakened to the fact that segregation is evil and that it must be destroyed in all forms. Your presence today proves that you have been aroused to the point of action."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284488468115193856
	studentactivism	Next, Lewis went on to condemn the bill for not including voting rights protections. "As it stands now," his elders added, but that wouldn't be changed before the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964. Voting would have to wait for the Voting Rights Act the following year.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284487271576752128
	studentactivism	"Of," on the other hand, is both tempered and ambiguous—the fear of a police state is a fear of something external, and maybe even hypothetical. A tiny change, but one that carries incredible weight.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284486556351430656
	studentactivism	Of all the changes Lewis had foisted on him that day, that one is maybe the most fascinating to me. "In a police state" is an emphatic statement about lived conditions, explicitly naming what it meant, what it was, to be Black in the Jim Crow South.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284486088799780864
	studentactivism	Lewis' elders had him change "the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear in a police state" to "...must live in constant fear OF a police state."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284484917242601472
	studentactivism	Danville had been the site of ongoing civil rights demonstrations and boycotts that spring and summer, and the city government had reacted brutally—beating protesters, many of them high school students, using fire hoses on them, cramming them into overcrowded jails.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284484686845284353
	studentactivism	Next, Lewis had written that the Kennedy civil rights bill ("in its present form" in the final version) would not "protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear in a police state."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284484585775079425
	studentactivism	And right after that, a line referring to the bill's failure to "protect young children and old women from police dogs and fire hoses" had the words "in the South" added to it.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284480377025961984
	studentactivism	Why didn't Lewis support the civil rights act "wholeheartedly"? Well, this line, appearing immediately after the one above, gives an indication: "There’s not one thing in the bill that will protect our people from police brutality." That line was struck entirely.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284479954474991618
	studentactivism	The first problem came in the speech's second sentence, where Lewis said the movement couldn't fully support JFK's civil rights bill, because it was "too little, too late." That got changed to "we support it with great reservation."	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284479340202332160
	studentactivism	In the end, the group negotiated more than a dozen significant changes to the speech, each of which moderated its tone and substance and many of which have particular resonance today. The final typed version was completed just moments before Lewis took the stage.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284477363288510464
	studentactivism	John Lewis was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington—where MLK gave the "I have a dream" speech—and the speech Lewis wrote that day was so incendiary that the march organizers wouldn't let him deliver it as written.	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1284472208006545408

	TracyWesterman	Indigenous ppl have a virtual absence of MENTAL HEALTH prevalence data. Wellbeing, “psychological” distress, negative life events-r what most of studies capture.

	TracyWesterman	The individual struggling with mental ill health (internal drivers) gets consistently lost in (external) “mob” explanations; e.g colonialism etc., It’s not clinically useful.

	OtherSociology	There are 69 COVID-19 cases in the towers. With coerced testing, this number was always going to be relatively high. There's 6.4 million Victorians. &lt;1M have been tested; esp. in 12 restricted zones. More migrants & refugees are picked up by virtue of being targeted for testing	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280492723456356353
	OtherSociology	The pandemic is unprecendented. It came right after the bushfires. It's a tough and unenviable position. However, it's clear that other Victorians will not be forced inside their homes with police at the door, confiscating food deliveries from them, and coercing them into testing	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280491037547323392
	OtherSociology	Premier highlighted that the 9 towers present a health emergency. But residents are not allowed to leave and they aren't being relocated into luxury hotels like other people in quarantine  They are in police detention even though the rest of Melbourne is under  lockdown	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280488245264957440
	OtherSociology	If the 12 restricted suburbs had been cut up differently, the chances of higher infection in Anglo majority areas would have increased. As Chief Health Officer concedes, most people who are positive don't know they are until they're tested, because they're ignoring mild symptoms	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280493608999612416
	OtherSociology	This is another racialised aspect of testing. Testing is very important. Victoria could have aimed for total testing. Instead it chose only highly multicultural suburbs, which make up less than 52% new infections. They didn't target Anglo suburbs that had higher rates in Wave 1..	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280493143410896896
	OtherSociology	Informed consent is one of the most important hallmarks of science and clinical operations. It is the hallmark of our national guidelines on ethics. Aboriginal people, disabled people, refugees, migrants, poor people are all groups that have been historically denied these rights	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280494580039811072
	OtherSociology	At the press conference, a journalist asked whether this treatment was fair, given most 2nd Wave infections come from the staff at the quarantine hotels, managed by the Gov. Another journalist asked if the Gov was taking responsibility. Premier said this isn't time for blame...	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280496915327725569
	OtherSociology	If everyone in Victoria was hearing loud messages in their homes to get tested, and they couldn't leave their houses, and police were at their doors—would we call this voluntary testing? The problem is the unequal treatment of the 9 towers BECAUSE they are poor, racial minorities	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1280496138328686600

	OtherSociology	During today's press conference, the Premier was asked whether data on infringement notices would be published in a timely way.

	OtherSociology	The Premier mentioned again, as he did yesterday, that detention of the 9 towers was done on advice of the Chief Health Officer. He emphasised there was no alternative.

	KGuilaine	1) Be very very cautious of those who claim there is little by way of *evidence*, that my friend is RACISM.

	Race-Related Differences in Promotions and Support: Underlying Effects of Human and Social Capital	This study examined two alternative explanations for disparity in reported work-related experiences and outcomes between black and white managers: treatment discrimination because of race, and differences in human and social capital. Education and training, representing human capital, and racial similarity of network ties and proportion of strong ties, representing social capital, were used to predict whether human and social capital would mediate the relationship between race and the work-related experiences and outcomes under investigation. Results of a survey of black and white managers in a Fortune 500 financial services firm indicate that black managers reported a slower rate of promotion and less psychosocial support than white managers. Race had both a direct and an indirect effect on these outcomes. Participation in company training significantly predicted reported promotion rates, but race remained a significant predictor. Additional analysis revealed that race moderates the relationship between human capital and promotion rate and suggests a type of treatment discrimination against blacks. Contrary to predictions, social capital did not predict promotion rate, although social capital mediated the relationship between race and psychosocial support. Black managers reported having less social capital than whites, and social capital, in turn, was positively related to the receipt of psychosocial support. No differences were found between blacks and whites in their receipt of career-related support.	https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640341

	When Blind Hiring Advances DEI - and When It Doesn't	As a decision-making strategy, "blind hiring" involves blocking evaluators from receiving potentially biasing information about a job candidate until after an evaluation of their application materials are complete. Most famously, the tactic was used to boost the hiring of women in orchestras by having people audition from behind a screen that concealed their gender. But there's a body of research that's been conducted since that 2000 study showing that, while the strategy is generally effective, there are situations in which it might not help you diversify your candidate pool. The author outlines this research, and suggests three questions you should ask in order to get the most out of a blind hiring approach.	https://hbr.org/2023/06/when-blind-hiring-advances-dei-and-when-it-doesnt

	Highlighting COVID-19 racial disparities can reduce support for safety precautions among White U.S. residents	U.S. media has extensively covered racial disparities in COVID-19 infections and deaths, which may ironically reduce public concern about COVID-19. In two preregistered studies (conducted in the fall of 2020), we examined whether perceptions of COVID-19 racial disparities predict White U.S. residents' attitudes toward COVID-19. Utilizing a correlational design (N¬†=¬†498), we found that those who perceived COVID-19 racial disparities to be greater reported reduced fear of COVID-19, which predicted reduced support for COVID-19 safety precautions. In Study 2, we manipulated exposure to information about COVID-19 racial disparities (N¬†=¬†1,505). Reading about the persistent inequalities that produced COVID-19 racial disparities reduced fear of COVID-19, empathy for those vulnerable to COVID-19, and support for safety precautions. These findings suggest that publicizing racial health disparities has the potential to create a vicious cycle wherein raising awareness reduces support for the very policies that could protect public health and reduce disparities.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795362200257X

	State-level macro-economic factors moderate the association of low income with brain structure and mental health in U.S. children	Macrostructural characteristics, such as cost of living and state-level anti-poverty programs relate to the magnitude of socioeconomic disparities in brain development and mental health. In this study we leveraged data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study from 10,633 9-11 year old youth (5115 female) across 17 states. Lower income was associated with smaller hippocampal volume and higher internalizing psychopathology. These associations were stronger in states with higher cost of living. However, in high cost of living states that provide more generous cash benefits for low-income families, socioeconomic disparities in hippocampal volume were reduced by 34%, such that the association of family income with hippocampal volume resembled that in the lowest cost of living states. We observed similar patterns for internalizing psychopathology. State-level anti-poverty programs and cost of living may be confounded with other factors related to neurodevelopment and mental health. However, the patterns were robust to controls for numerous state-level social, economic, and political characteristics. These findings suggest that state-level macrostructural characteristics, including the generosity of anti-poverty policies, are potentially relevant for addressing the relationship of low income with brain development and mental health.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37778-1

	Net effects: examining strategies for women's inclusion and influence in ASX200 company boards	Conventional approaches to improving the representation of women on the boards of major companies typically focus on increasing the number of women appointed to these positions. We show that this strategy alone does not improve gender equity. Instead of relying on aggregate statistics ("headcounts") to evaluate women's inclusion, we use network analysis to identify and examine two types of influence in corporate board networks: local influence measured by degree centrality and global influence measured by betweenness centrality and k-core centrality. Comparing board membership data from Australia's largest 200 listed companies in the ASX200 index in 2015 and 2018 respectively, we demonstrate that despite an increase in the number of women holding board seats during this time, their agency in terms of these network measures remains substantively unchanged. We argue that network analysis offers more nuanced approaches to measuring women's inclusion in organizational networks and will facilitate more successful outcomes for gender diversity and equity.	https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-022-00490-y

	Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders?	Why are so few women in management positions? The popular explanations range from women just aren't capable of being leaders to women just don't want to be leaders. According to the author, however, the absence of women in leadership roles has less to do with women themselves and more to do with how we interpret leadership traits. Confidence - a trait more associated with men - is often misinterpreted as competence. As a result, charismatic, but incompetent men have fewer barriers to reach the top than women. Individuals in positions to promote and hire managers should think more critically about what seems like a leadership trait versus what is an actual leadership trait. They will find that arrogance and overconfidence - the characteristics that get men into management positions - are also the characteristics that cause poor performance.	https://hbr.org/2013/08/why-do-so-many-incompetent-men

Reflections on labels in a diverse nation	Born from the realisation that labels as they relate to cultural communities are limited, this insightful essay considers use of the term 'Culturally and Linguistically Diverse' (CALD) and whether it's still the most meaningful way to describe and measure our diversity. ¬† Using real stories, Prentice exposes the tensions individuals face and the power of choice when it comes to labelling and describing oneself. She highlights the complexity associated with cultural identity and the difficulty in reducing what is personal, layered and nuanced to a single label. ¬† In the context of an increasingly diverse country, the author seeks to generate discussion by questioning whether the term CALD is still serving the purpose for which it was intended.	https://scanloninstitute.org.au/publications/essays/reflections-on-labels

	Lucy Salani	Lucy Salani (12 August 1924 - 22 March 2023) was an Italian activist and the only known Italian transgender person to have survived the Nazi concentration camps.Born in Fossano and raised in Bologna, Salani was understood to be a homosexual man before undergoing gender reassignment surgery later in her life. An anti-fascist, she deserted both the fascist Italian and the Nazi German armies during World War II, before getting caught and deported to the Dachau concentration camp in 1944, where she remained until the liberation of the camp by the American troops in April 1945. Following her liberation and the end of the war, Salani lived in Rome, Turin and Paris, before completing her transition in London. She then returned to Bologna in the 1980s, eventually spending the rest of her life in the city.  Salani's life story gained public attention during the 2010s, as writer and director Gabriella Romano dedicated a biography and a documentary to her.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Salani&oldid=1154533138

	Academics of colour in elite universities in the UK and the USA: the 'unspoken system of exclusion'	This article explores the experiences of academics of colour in elite universities in the UK and the USA. Drawing on interviews with 34 respondents and using a critical race theory perspective, the findings indicate that academics of colour experience racism in the White space of an elite university. To counter the racism they experience, they develop 'safe spaces' in which they find empathy and support from other academics of colour. A key finding from the study suggests that despite having negative experiences in elite universities, academics of colour have contradictory feelings about their positions. They disassociate themselves from the racism by recognising the status and prestige associated with working at an elite university. This article suggests that in order for academics of colour to be fully included in elite universities, institutions must acknowledge racism and their own Whiteness to work towards cultural change.	https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2021.2020746
	Push for a Royal Commission into 'robo-NDIS'	The Royal Commission into Robodebt heard significant revelations about the series of failures that led up to the illegal tech-based scheme.¬†Robodebt involved the use of an algorithm to average out a welfare recipient's yearly income using data from the tax office cross-matched with income reported to Centrelink. If the system identified a discrepancy, a "please explain" notice was sent to the recipient, with the onus placed on them to prove the debt didn't exist.¬†The system was found to regularly incorrectly match this data and create debts that were inaccurate or did not exist at all. The scheme was eventually found to be unlawful, with the federal government agreeing to refund $720 million debts, scrap $400 million in debts and provide $112 million in compensation.¬†The Royal Commission has held hearings this year to investigate the scheme and how similar failures can be prevented in the future.	https://www.innovationaus.com/push-for-a-royal-commission-into-robo-ndis/

	Is there a glass ceiling for ethnic minorities to enter leadership positions? Evidence from a field experiment with over 12,000 job applications	We conducted a field experiment to analyze if there is a glass ceiling for ethnic minorities entering leadership positions in organizations. We submitted over 12,000 job applications, to over 4,000 job advertisements, to investigate hiring discrimination against six ethnic groups for leadership positions. Drawing on implicit leadership theory, we argue that ethnic discrimination is particularly pronounced in the recruitment of leadership positions. The results confirm this hypothesis. For leadership positions, applicants with English names received 26.8% of positive responses for their job applications, while applicants with non-English names received 11.3% of positive responses. This means ethnic minorities received 57.4% fewer positive responses than applicants with English names for leadership positions despite identical resumes. For non-leadership positions, applicants with English names received 21.2% of positive responses for their job applications, while applicants with non-English names received 11.6% of positive responses. This means ethnic minorities received 45.3% fewer positive responses for non-leadership positions despite identical resumes. Ethnic discrimination for leadership positions was even more pronounced when the advertised job required customer contact. In contrast, hiring discrimination for leadership positions was not significantly influenced by whether the job advertisement emphasized individualism or learning, creativity, and innovation. Our findings provide novel evidence of a glass ceiling for ethnic minorities to enter leadership positions.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984322000583

	Too Much Labour.	The most difficult thing about being disabled, in my opinion at least, is not ableism. It’s not the strange looks you get in the street, or having to navigate a world physically not built to accommodate you. It’s not even the symptoms of my condition. No, by far the biggest downside to being disabled is the physical and emotional labour that stems from disability.  Very few things are simple and straightforward when you’re disabled. Visiting anywhere new is a nightmare, with disabled people usually needing to visit special websites or contact businesses directly in order to obtain essential access information, instead of simply being able to turn up and assume they can get in the building. Quite often accessible services require booking in advance, removing the ability to be spontaneous, particularly when it comes to travel.  	https://diaryofadisabledperson.blog/2023/04/09/too-much-labour/

	Ditsy is 19 years-old and homeless in Salt Lake City. All the kids in this video are homeless!	Ditsy is 19 years-old and homeless in Salt Lake City, Utah. As you'll quickly see, Ditsy loves kids. He told me that helping and playing with the homeless kids in the park makes him feel better about his younger years. Although this was a fun interview, the fact that every kid in this video is homeless is a serious tragedy.     Ditsy says being a homeless youth is not the hardest thing he has done, but it's also not the easiest. He says he struggles for food, and has to worry about police when sleeping. As hard as homelessness is, Ditsy says if you can stay optimistic, it becomes a little easier. Smart words for such a young man.     When I started to talk to Ditsy about sharing his story the kids were not really around. Before I knew it the kids became part of this story so I just ran with it. While recording, I kept thinking about the challenges of finding all the parents to get their permission. This was a public park at dusk, and who knows where everyone is.     Ditsy took me to the first mother and I handed her a business card. I give everyone a business card with my email and cell number. The mother didn't really say much when another woman, surrounded by a group of people, started to yell at me to come to her. The first mother ran to this woman and handed her my business card. My first thoughts were that I was in trouble. My second thought was that no way was I going to get permission and this whole thing is about to go bad.     To my shock, the woman asked me to take photos of all their kids and family portraits of everyone. There were probably 3 or maybe 4 homeless families hanging out, and they all wanted portraits. I am not a still photographer and my gear is all setup for video. It was dark, I didn't have lights, and I had the wrong lens. I only say that because I wish I could have done better for all of them. I told them I would let me friends at Help Portrait [http://help-portrait.com] know what shelter they are in so they can get photos done right.     For the next 45 minutes I had so much fun, and so did all of them posing for photos. It was as if the world was alright and none of them were experimenting homelessness. Here is a link to a few of the family portraits I took tonight http://hardlynormal.tumblr.com/post/5... So obviously, not only did I get every parents permission I made a bunch of new friends in the process. It's a night I'll never forget that's for sure.

	Interplay of diversity, inclusion, and politics: Impact on employee well-being	Workforce diversity literature highlights adverse effects of surface diversity on employee affect. We examine the applicability of surface diversity effects in the Indian social milieu. Since diversity effects are context-specific, in a first, we test the moderating impact of employee's perceived organisational politics on the inclusion mediated diversity-well-being link among 617 employees from Indian organisations. Post ascertaining the measurement model fit using AMOS 22, we used PROCESS to test for moderated-mediation effects. Perception of organisational politics moderated the surface diversity-inclusion-well-being link such that inclusion was found to be weaker for employees who perceived high politics. We discuss the implications for managers.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0970389622000684

	Trends in racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring in six Western countries	We examine trends in racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring in six European and North American countries: Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States. Our sample includes all available discrimination estimates from 90 field experimental studies of hiring discrimination, encompassing more than 170,000 applications for jobs. The years covered vary by country, ranging from 1969 to 2017 for Great Britain to 1994 to 2017 for Germany. We examine trends in discrimination against four racial-ethnic origin groups: African/Black, Asian, Latin American/Hispanic, and Middle Eastern or North African. The results indicate that levels of discrimination in callbacks have remained either unchanged or slightly increased overall for most countries and origin categories. There are three notable exceptions. First, hiring discrimination against ethnic groups with origins in the Middle East and North Africa increased during the 2000s relative to the 1990s. Second, we find that discrimination in France declined, although from very high to "merely" high levels. Third, we find evidence that discrimination in the Netherlands has increased over time. Controls for study characteristics do not change these trends. Contrary to the idea that discrimination will tend to decline in Western countries, we find that discrimination has not fallen over the last few decades in five of the six Western countries we examine.	https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2212875120

	Why and when female directors are less engaged in their board duties: An interface perspective	Female representation on boards is perhaps one of the most studied topics in board-governance research. At the same time, much is unknown about female directors' task engagement within boards. Drawing from psychological theory on societal gender beliefs, our study tests whether the impact of director gender on supervisory task engagement hinges on status dynamics in two relational interfaces: the director-board interface and the director-CEO interface. According to this perspective, female directors show less task engagement because gender is a diffuse status cue that creates status differentiation within the director-board interface. Multi-source board survey data (n¬†=¬†61 boards, n¬†=¬†315 directors) confirms that, within the confines of the boardroom, female directors do, indeed, receive lower-status ratings than male directors. This effect is weaker when boards have a female chair. Furthermore, lower status explains perceived lower task engagement of female directors, but this link critically hinges on the CEO-director interface. The impact of status differences is more pronounced when directors intersect with a relatively dominant CEO. All in all, the results demonstrate that relational interfaces play a key role for female directors' task engagement in their board duties.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024630121000546

	Don't Just Sponsor Women and People of Color - Defend Them	Having an "overly" analytical and unemotional leadership style is a complaint many female leaders and leaders from marginalized racial groups have levied at them. Others are criticized for being "too emotional." In general, these leaders often suffer from the Goldilocks dilemma: They're either being too much of one thing or not enough of that same thing. When such criticisms are levied, it's critical for female leaders and leaders of color to have people willing to sponsor them by defending them to others. Defending comes with a certain amount of risk, and it's the responsibility of the most powerful sponsors - typically white men - to take on that risk.	https://hbr.org/2023/02/dont-just-sponsor-women-and-people-of-color-defend-them
	Ricki Tarr (@RickiTarr@beige.party)	I am white, and was raised in small mostly white communities when I was young, but moved to a larger city as a young teenager. Like a lot of white kids, I didn't understand how much of a thing casual everyday racism was, until I met my future best friend Cameron. I'd never been pulled over by the cops before, and now suddenly I was getting pulled over frequently, for no reason at all, the only difference was now there was a black man in the car. I remember the first time getting pulled over, and the cop asking for all of our ID's with no explanation at all, Cam saw me about to mouth off, and the look of terror on his face made me shut up immediately. Later, he told me when it happened again to just comply, don't ask questions, don't get angry. I had never had to view cops with fear before, in my mind, you only needed to be afraid if you were a criminal, but Cam was afraid, just for existing as black. If people try to tell you that black people are dramatizing their struggle, they are lying!	https://beige.party/@RickiTarr/109857811337655238

	Digestive system infection by SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2: Entry mechanism, clinical symptoms and expression of major receptors (Review)	Besides causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS‚Äëcoronavirus 2 (SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2) also harms the digestive system. Given the appearance of numerous cases of SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2, it has been demonstrated that SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 is able to harm target organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas, and either worsen the condition of patients with basic digestive illnesses or make their prognosis poor. According to several previously published studies, angiotensin‚Äëconverting enzyme II (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease II (TMPRSS2) are expressed either singly or in combination in the digestive system and in other regions of the human body. In order to change the viral conformation, create a fusion hole and release viral RNA into the host cell for replication and transcription, SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 is capable of binding to these two proteins through the spike protein on its surface. As a result, the body experiences an immune reaction and an inflammatory reaction, which may lead to nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and even gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated levels of liver enzymes, acute liver injury, pancreatitis and other serious lesions. In order to provide possible strategies for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of digestive system diseases during the COVID‚Äë19 pandemic, the molecular structure of SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 and the mechanism via which SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 enters the human body through ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were discussed in the present review, and the clinical manifestations of SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 infection in the digestive system were also summarized. Finally, the expression characteristics of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the main target organs of the digestive system were described.	https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijmm.2023.5222

	Resilience, higher education and widening participation: generating change for care experienced students	Over 80,000 children in England were being looked after in Local Authority care in 2020 and a further 40,000 people were defined as 'care leavers'. Although a significant body of research highlights the prevalence of educational low achievement in the care experienced population, official government figures show that around 13% of care experienced pupils progress to higher education by the age of 19. In a climate of 'widening participation' in which universities encourage inclusion and student diversity, this research invited students with a care background to discuss their experiences of settling into university life. Data was collected using in-depth interviews with 42 students from four universities and an online survey completed by 192 students in 29 universities in England and Wales. Findings revealed that although care experienced students overcome significant challenges to progress to higher education, over half considered dropping out. Others reported feeling isolated and inadequately supported, both financially and pastorally, by their institution. This paper uses a lens of resilience to consider the environmental factors that impact upon student transitions, and concludes that universities must act to balance inequalities in order to appropriately welcome and appreciate care leavers for the skills and experience they bring.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-022-00985-8

	Decolonizing Inclusive Education through Trauma-Informed Theories	Notwithstanding its noble orientations and social justice foundations, inclusion has been contested, interrogated, and subjected to multiple interpretations and enactments. Inclusive education has been, inter alia, characterized as a neo-colonial project that is embroiled in and reinforces geopolitical power asymmetries and oppressive regimes. The article suggests that the enduring legacy of colonial perspectives needs to be problematized and challenged through a trauma-responsive lens that captures the traumatizing effects of colonialism/ty on the 'lived' realities of disabled and other disenfranchised groups of students. Trauma is a constituent element of intersectional oppression stemming from and imbricated in conditions of colonial structures of power that conceal and legitimize social inequalities, extreme poverty, malnutrition, violence, substandard childcare, racism, and other 'cultural' traumas. This is an issue that highlights the imperative of developing theories of inclusion that acknowledge and address the intersections of colonialism/ty, disability and trauma and their impact on educational accessibility, participation, and achievement.	http://www.sjdr.se/articles/10.16993/sjdr.951/

	Hypervisibility and Invisibility: Black Women's Experiences with Gendered Racial Microaggressions on a White Campus	This study focuses on the gendered racial microaggressions that Black undergraduate women experience while attending a historically predominately white university. Expanding from the racial microaggression literature, gendered racial microaggressions demonstrate how race is gendered and how gender is racialized for Black women. Because Black women experience dual oppression, the microaggressions they receive should be examined from an intersectional perspective. My study helps fill in the gaps of literature by taking an intersectional perspective to explore and center Black college women's experiences with gendered racism by examining the gendered racial microaggressions they experience within the classroom and in general areas on campus. This study took a qualitative approach to uncover Black women's experiences with microaggressions at a white university. I interviewed 25 Black undergraduate women who attended a flagship university in the Midwest. Gendered racial microaggressions showed up in themes of hypervisibility within classroom settings and invisibility in general spaces on campus. Within classroom settings, Black undergraduate women's race and gender were seen as hypervisible and were microaggressed by white classmates and white faculty. On the contrary, in general spaces on campus, Black women were ignored or excluded from conversations with white students. Both invisibility and hypervisibility speak of Black women's marginalization. Their experiences demonstrate the ways that both sexist and racist ideas about Black women and their abilities contribute to their marginalization, invalidation, and erasure on campus.	http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23326492221138222

	Hyper/neuroinflammation in COVID-19 and suicide etiopathogenesis: Hypothesis for a nefarious collision?	Accumulating scientific and clinical evidence highlighted pathological hyperinflammation as a cardinal feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute COVID-19 disease. With the emergence of long COVID-19 syndrome, several chronic health consequences, including neuropsychiatric sequelae, have gained attention from the public and medical communities. Since inflammatory mediators have also been accredited as putative biomarkers of suicidal ideations and behaviors, hyper- and neuroinflammation might share some colliding points, overlapping and being interconnected in the context of COVID-19. This review aims to provide a summary of current knowledge on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of COVID-19-associated hyper/neuroinflammation with focus on their relevance to the inflammatory hypothesis of suicide development. Subsequently, strategies to alleviate COVID-19 hyper/neuroinflammation by immunomodulatory agents (many of which at experimental stages) as well as psychopharmacologic/psychotherapeutic approaches are also mentioned. While suicide risk in COVID-19 survivors - until now little known - needs further analysis through longitudinal studies, current observations and mechanistic postulates warrant additional attention to this possibly emerging mental health concern.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763422000951

Nonetheless, when you are trying to excel inside of these environments, it's a lot to go up against.

	The wicked problem of B(A)ME degree award gaps and systemic racism in our universities	The independent regulator for higher education in England, the Office for Students (OfS), set new national targets in late 2018 to achieve equality of opportunity in higher education by tackling degree award gaps. The sector response to this was to measure degree award gaps between B(A)ME students and white students in their higher education institutions. Analysis of degree award gaps using quantitative methods has revealed an "unexplained gap". We argue that the existence of this "unexplained gap" is evidence of "systemic racism". However, the factors influencing a degree award and their associated gaps across different racialized groups of students are so complex, that its problematisation, never-mind its solution is inherently complex. It is our view, therefore, racialized degree award gaps are a wicked problem. Despite this, it is also our view that it is an important social justice endeavor that we must still seek to address as a sector. To do so, we propose a mixed methods approach that uses dynamic centring and an intersectional lens to better understand the experiences of racialized students within the higher education "system". Current quantitative analysis of degree award gaps simply tells us how different groups of racialized students experience the system. In using a mixed methods approach in the way we outline, we may better understand the racialized lived experience of our students and the factors influencing the experience of different racialized groups within the "system". This solution-focused approach can help create opportunities that enable students to better navigate social structures and systems and improve their experience in the system. However, this will not address the wicked problem of degree award gaps itself, which is complex, pervasive, and messy.	https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsoc.2022.971923

	The Surprising Benefits of Work/Life Support	To succeed, almost every employee needs work/life support at some point. Women and people of color need it the most, research shows, because they face greater challenges and have fewer resources available to them. They are also the least likely to receive it, however, and as a result often are forced to change or leave jobs and lose out on opportunities for advancement. Given that situation, the authors decided to examine what effects various corporate work/life programs had on the management workforce. Analyzing data from more than 800 U.S. companies over 30 years, they found that when companies offered flexible work schedules, family leave, and childcare support to all employees, the percentage of women and people of color in management rose significantly. In fact, those work/life benefits had a larger impact than the most popular racial-equity programs did. Companies have long known that programs promoting work/life balance boost productivity, reduce turnover, and improve employees' mental and physical health. And now it's clear that they are also a powerful way to increase organizational diversity.	https://hbr.org/2022/09/the-surprising-benefits-of-work-life-support

	Nobel and Novice: Author Prominence Affects Peer Review	Peer-review is a well-established cornerstone of the scientific process, yet it is not immune to status bias. Merton identified the problem as one in which prominent researchers get disproportionately great credit for their contribution while relatively unknown researchers get disproportionately little credit (Merton, 1968). We measure the extent of this effect in the peer-review process through a pre-registered field experiment. We invite more than 3,300 researchers to review a paper jointly written by a prominent author - a Nobel laureate - and by a relatively unknown author - an early-career research associate -, varying whether reviewers see the prominent author's name, an anonymized version of the paper, or the less well-known author's name. We find strong evidence for the status bias: while only 23 percent recommend "reject" when the prominent researcher is the only author shown, 48 percent do so when the paper is anonymized, and 65 percent do so when the little-known author is the only author shown. Our findings complement and extend earlier results on double-anonymized vs. single-anonymized review (Peters and Ceci, 1982; Blank, 1991; Cox et al., 1993; Okike et al., 2016; Tomkins et al., 2017; Card and Della Vigna, 2020) and strongly suggest that double-anonymization is a minimum requirement for an unbiased review process.	https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4190976

	We can talk the talk, but we're not allowed to walk the walk': the role of equality and diversity staff in higher education institutions in England	This article draws on interviews with 41 equality and diversity staff in higher education institutions in England who were not members of the Race Equality Charter (REC). It uses the concept of Whiteness and White privilege to argue that within the framework of White normative practices, the role of equality and diversity staff are used as a smokescreen to perpetuate a system of White privilege. Higher education institutions who are not members of the REC do not invest in such initiatives to protect their own White interests. Rather, they give the appearance of addressing equalities under the guise of the Equality Act (2010). The article argues that in order for racial inequalities to be addressed, policy making such as the REC must be mandatory. Furthermore, higher education institutions must consider how they empower equality and diversity staff in order that they have the time, resources and commitment from senior managers to instigate real organisational change.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-022-00835-7

	Capitalism and extreme poverty: A global analysis of real wages, human height, and mortality since the long 16th century	This paper assesses claims that, prior to the 19th century, around 90% of the human population lived in extreme poverty (defined as the inability to access essential goods), and that global human welfare only began to improve with the rise of capitalism. These claims rely on national accounts and PPP exchange rates that do not adequately capture changes in people's access to essential goods. We assess this narrative against extant data on three empirical indicators of human welfare: real wages (with respect to a subsistence basket), human height, and mortality. We ask whether these indicators improved or deteriorated with the rise of capitalism in five world regions - Europe, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and China - using the chronology put forward by world-systems theorists. The evidence we review here points to three conclusions. (1) It is unlikely that 90% of the human population lived in extreme poverty prior to the 19th century. Historically, unskilled urban labourers in all regions tended to have wages high enough to support a family of four above the poverty line by working 250¬†days or 12 months a year, except during periods of severe social dislocation, such as famines, wars, and institutionalized dispossession - particularly under colonialism. (2) The rise of capitalism caused a dramatic deterioration of human welfare. In all regions studied here, incorporation into the capitalist world-system was associated with a decline in wages to below subsistence, a deterioration in human stature, and an upturn in premature mortality. In parts of South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, key welfare metrics have still not recovered. (3) Where progress has occurred, significant improvements in human welfare began several centuries after the rise of capitalism. In the core regions of Northwest Europe, progress began in the 1880s, while in the periphery and semi-periphery it began in the mid-20th century, a period characterized by the rise of anti-colonial and socialist political movements that redistributed incomes and established public provisioning systems.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X22002169

	Coniston massacre	The Coniston massacre, which took place in the region around the Coniston cattle station in the then Territory of Central Australia (now the Northern Territory) from 14 August to 18 October 1928, was the last known officially sanctioned massacre of Indigenous Australians and one of the last events of the Australian Frontier Wars.  In a series of punitive expeditions led by Northern Territory Police constable William George Murray, people of the Warlpiri, Anmatyerre, and Kaytetye groups were killed. The massacre occurred in response to the murder of dingo hunter Frederick Brooks, killed by Aboriginal people in August 1928 at a place called Yukurru, also known as Brooks Soak. Official records at the time state that at least 31 people were killed, however analysis of existing documentation and Aboriginal oral histories reveal that the fatalities were likely to have been as high as 200.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coniston_massacre&oldid=1096999023

	Ten simple rules to host an inclusive conference	Conferences are spaces to meet and network within and across academic and technical fields, learn about new advances, and share our work. They can help define career paths and create long-lasting collaborations and opportunities. However, these opportunities are not equal for all. This article introduces 10 simple rules to host an inclusive conference based on the authors' recent experience organizing the 2021 edition of the useR! statistical computing conference, which attracted a broad range of participants from academia, industry, government, and the nonprofit sector. Coming from different backgrounds, career stages, and even continents, we embraced the challenge of organizing a high-quality virtual conference in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and making it a kind, inclusive, and accessible experience for as many people as possible. The rules result from our lessons learned before, during, and after the organization of the conference. They have been written mainly for potential organizers and selection committees of conferences and contain multiple practical tips to help a variety of events become more accessible and inclusive. We see this as a starting point for conversations and efforts towards building more inclusive conferences across the world. * Translated versions of the English abstract and the list of rules are available in 10 languages in S1 Text: Arabic, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, and Thai.	https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010164

	The moral psychology of misinformation: Why we excuse dishonesty in a post-truth world	Commentators say we have entered a "post-truth" era. As political lies and "fake news" flourish, citizens appear not only to believe misinformation, but also to condone misinformation they do not believe. The present article reviews recent research on three psychological factors that encourage people to condone misinformation: partisanship, imagination, and repetition. Each factor relates to a hallmark of "post-truth" society: political polarization, leaders who push "alterative facts," and technology that amplifies disinformation. By lowering moral standards, convincing people that a lie's "gist" is true, or dulling affective reactions, these factors not only reduce moral condemnation of misinformation, but can also amplify partisan disagreement. We discuss implications for reducing the spread of misinformation.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X2200094X

	Women are Credited Less in Science than are Men	There is a well-documented gap in the observed number of scientific works produced by women and men in science, with clear consequences for the retention and promotion of women in science1. The gap might be a result of productivity differences2-5, or it might be due to women's contributions not being acknowledged6,7. This paper finds that at least part of this gap is due to the latter: women in research teams are significantly less likely to be credited with authorship than are men. The findings are consistent across three very different sources of data. Analysis of the first source - large scale administrative data on research teams, team scientific output, and attribution of credit - show that women are significantly less likely to be named on any given article or patent produced by their team relative to their peers. The gender gap in attribution is found across almost all scientific fields and career stages. The second source - an extensive survey of authors - similarly shows that women's scientific contributions are systematically less likely to be recognized. The third source - qualitative responses - suggests that the reason is that their work is often not known, not appreciated, or ignored. At least some of the observed gender gap in scientific output may not be due to differences in scientific contribution, but to differences in attribution.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04966-w

	Nalanda: India's ancient university rising from the ashes	Founded in the 5th Century, India's Nalanda University is believed to be the world's first residential university. Established more than 500 years before Oxford University, at its peak Nalanda hosted over 10,000 students from around the world and was considered one of the greatest centres of learning in the ancient world. The university was destroyed around the end of the 12th Century, its legendary library burnt to the ground and much of its ancient knowledge lost. It wasn't until the 19th Century that the ruins of Nalanda were rediscovered, and now, around 800 years after it was lost, the university is being relaunched for the modern age.

In the novel, Sam Vimes, the captain of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, reasons that poverty causes greater expenses to the poor than to those who are richer. Since its publication, the theory has received wider attention, especially in regard to the effect of increasing prices of daily necessities.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boots_theory&oldid=1090480288

	Trust and accountability in UK charities: Exploring the virtuous circle	Public trust and confidence in charities is essential for the achievement of their missions. However, recent evidence suggests that trust in UK charities has been damaged, potentially affecting charities' and the charity sector's sustainability and effectiveness. This paper constructs accountability as an important means of developing, maintaining and restoring trust in charities. Through a series of interviews with charity managers, it investigates the public and private mechanisms used in discharging accountability to, and building trust with, charities' main stakeholder groups. The paper identifies the use of a wide range of mechanisms, often highly tailored to particular stakeholders' perceived information needs, which are seen as critical in this process. It is argued that the use and interplay of these can create a 'virtuous circle' of accountability and trust, where each reinforces the other. It is argued that where this is achieved, trust in individual charities, and the sector as a whole, can be enhanced.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890838917300549

Although Indigenous Australians account for only approximately 3.5% of the country's population, over 50% of Australians were born overseas or have at least one migrant parent. Migration accounts for over 60% of Australia's population growth, with migration from Asia, Sub-Saharan African and the Americas increasing by 500% in the last decade.

	To a Safer Place	This inspiring film is the story of how one woman has come to terms with her life as a survivor of incest. Sexually abused by her father from infancy to early adolescence, Shirley Turcotte is now in her thirties and has succeeded in building a rich and full life. In To a Safer Place, Shirley takes a further step to reconcile her past and present. The film accompanies her as she returns to the people and places of her childhood. Her mother, brothers and sister, all of whom were also caught up in the cycle of family violence, openly share their thoughts. Their frank disclosures will encourage survivors of incest to break through the silence and betrayal to recover and develop a sense of self-worth and dignity.

	Waking up to Marginalization: Public Value Failures in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science	Data science education is increasingly becoming an integral part of many educational structures, both informal and formal. Much of the attention has been on the application of AI principles and techniques, especially machine learning, natural language processing and predictive analytics. While AI is only one phase in the data science ecosystem, we must embrace a fuller range of job roles that help manage AI algorithms and systems - from the AI innovators and architects (in CS, Math and Statistics) to the AI technicians and specialists (in CS, IT and IS). Also, it's important that we better understand the current state of the low participation and representation of minoritized groups that further stifles the accessibility and inclusion efforts. However, how we learn and what we learn is highly dependent on who we are as learners. In this paper, we examine demographic disparities by race/ethnicity and gender within the information systems educational infrastructure from an evaluative perspective. More specifically, we adopt intersectional methods and apply the theory of public value failure to identify learning gaps in the fast-growing field of data science. National datasets of Master's and Doctoral graduate students in IS, CS, Math and Statistics are used to create an "institutional parity score" which calculates field-specific representation by race/ethnicity and gender in data science related fields. We conclude by showcasing bias creep including the situational exclusion of individuals from access to the broader information economy, be it access to technologies and data or access to participate in the data workforce or data enabled-economic activity. Policy recommendations are suggested to curb and reduce this marginalization within information systems and related disciplines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v142/monroe-white21a.html

	How the Best Bosses Interrupt Bias on Their Teams	Companies spend millions on antibias training each year in hopes of creating more-inclusive-and thereby innovative and effective-workforces. Studies show that well-managed diverse groups perform better and are more committed, have higher collective intelligence, and excel at making decisions and solving problems. But research also shows that bias-prevention programs rarely deliver. So what can you, as an individual leader, do to ensure that your team is including and making the most of diverse voices? How can one person fix what an entire organization can't? Although bias itself is devilishly hard to change, it is not as difficult to interrupt. The authors have identified several practices that managers can use to counter bias (and avoid its negative effects) without spending a lot of time or political capital. In hiring, leaders should insist on a diverse pool, precommit to objective criteria, limit referral hiring, and structure interviews around skills-based questions. Day to day, they should ensure that high- and low-value work is assigned evenly and run meetings in a way that guarantees all voices are heard. In evaluating and developing people, they should clarify criteria for positive reviews and promotions, stick to those rules, and separate potential from performance and personality from skill sets.	https://hbr.org/2019/11/how-the-best-bosses-interrupt-bias-on-their-teams

	Identifying and dismantling racism in Australian perinatal settings: Reframing the narrative from a risk lens to intentionally prioritise connectedness and strengths in providing care to First Nations families	Introduction  The perinatal period is a time when provision of responsive care offers a life course opportunity for positive change to improve health outcomes for mothers, infants and families. Australian perinatal systems carry the legacy of settler-colonialism, manifesting in racist events and interactions that First Nations parents encounter daily.  Objective  The dominance of a western risk lens, and conscious and unconscious bias in the child protection workforce, sustains disproportionately high numbers of First Nations infants being removed from their parents' care. Cascading medical interventions compound existing stressors and magnify health inequities for First Nations women.  Design  Critical discourse was informed by Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing via targeted dialogue with a group of First Nations and non-Indigenous experts in Australian perinatal care who are co-authors on this paper. Dynamic discussion evolved from a series of yarning circles, supplemented by written exchanges and individual yarns as themes were consolidated.  Results  First Nations maternity services prioritise self-determination, partnership, strengths and communication and have demonstrated positive outcomes with, and high satisfaction from First Nations women. Mainstream perinatal settings could be significantly enhanced by embracing similar principles and models of care.  Conclusions and relevance  The Australian Anti-racism in Perinatal Practice (AAPP) Alliance calls for urgent transformations to Australian perinatal models of care whereby non-Indigenous health policy makers, managers and clinicians take a proactive role in identifying and redressing ethnocentrism, judgemental and culturally blind practices, reframing the risk narrative, embedding strength-based approaches and intentionally prioritising engagement and connectedness within service delivery.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871519222000749

	So many people are quick to call themselves allies or would like to think that they are one, but one of the biggest misconceptions about being an ally is that continuing to show up is hard and often involves taking risks.     These are just some of the barriers I'm identifying in people I work with on a regular basis who think they have the intention to be a true ally. What do you think is missing? Be honest!    To be a impactful ally, you need to be consistent and proactive but often these things are getting in the way.

	The Diversity-Innovation Paradox in Science	Significance    By analyzing data from nearly all US PhD recipients and their dissertations across three decades, this paper finds demographically underrepresented students innovate at higher rates than majority students, but their novel contributions are discounted and less likely to earn them academic positions. The discounting of minorities' innovations may partly explain their underrepresentation in influential positions of academia.    ,    Prior work finds a diversity paradox: Diversity breeds innovation, yet underrepresented groups that diversify organizations have less successful careers within them. Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well? We study this by utilizing a near-complete population of ‚àº1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977 to 2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity's role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.	https://pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1915378117

	Ethical Machine Learning in Healthcare	The use of machine learning (ML) in healthcare raises numerous ethical concerns, especially as models can amplify existing health inequities. Here, we outline ethical considerations for equitable ML in the advancement of healthcare. Specifically, we frame ethics of ML in healthcare through the lens of social justice. We describe ongoing efforts and outline challenges in a proposed pipeline of ethical ML in health, ranging from problem selection to postdeployment considerations. We close by summarizing recommendations to address these challenges.

	As Masks Come Off, Immunocompromised Americans Feel Left Behind	The latest CDC guidance puts nearly 70% of the U.S. population in low or medium risk areas, and residents are no longer expected to wear a mask. In response, the vast majority of states in the U.S. have lifted or plan to lift mask mandates.    While many Americans welcome the loosening of pandemic-era safety rules, people who are higher risk feel forgotten and left behind. Johnnie Jae is an Indigenous journalist and public speaker; Charis Hill is a disability activist; and Cass Condray is a university student.

	A framework for operationalising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander data sovereignty in Australia: Results of a systematic literature review of published studies	Background  Racial health disparities are only likely to be meaningfully improved by tailoring public health and clinical interventions to the specific needs of Indigenous people and their communities. Accurate tailoring relies on the availability of high-quality Indigenous-specific data. The potential benefits of increased availability of Indigenous data need to be balanced by efforts to ensure those data are collected and used appropriately. This paper identifies characteristics of Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) principles and considers a framework for operationalisation.  Methods  A PRISMA compliant search of the literature was undertaken, using methods detailed in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook on Systematic Reviews of Health Promotion and Public Health Interventions (1). The search strategy comprised two steps: a search of 11 scientific electronic databases and five grey literature sources. The search was limited by date of publication (1 January 2000 to 1 December 2021). The following keywords and subject heading terms were used: (exp Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander or Aborigin* or Torres Strait Island* or, Oceanic ancestry group) and (exp research or biomedical research or population surveillance or translational medical research or, research design) and (exp data or datasets or data collection or data management or health surveys or information dissemination or, intellectual property) and (exp self-determination or ownership or control or access or possession or OCAP or sovereignty or, ethics) and, (exp Australia). IDS principles: (i) ownership; (ii) control; (iii) accessibility; (iv) custodianship; (v) accountability to Indigenous people; (vi) amplify Community voice; (vii) relevant and reciprocal; and (viii) sustainably self-determining. Using standard data extraction forms, we examined relevant Australian studies to identify key characteristics and frequency with which they cited IDS principles. These findings were consolidated into an operationalisation framework.  Findings  34 relevant Australian published studies were identified. The most frequently cited IDS principles were Accountability to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and sustainably self-determining. The least frequently cited principle was Access. A framework to operationalise IDS principles is proposed that is both standardised internationally and able to be tailored to the diverse contexts of Indigenous peoples.  Interpretation  IDS is emergent in Australia and there is a clear need to establish an agreed set of International IDS principles and a framework for their operationalisation and contextualisation across diverse Indigenous communities and contexts.  Funding  This research project is funded through an Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Grant from 2017 to 2022. The National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC) is funded by the Australian Government Department of Health. The 1st author (ST) is supported by a scholarship co-funded by NDARC and the Lowitja Institute.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537022000323

	Snapshot		https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot
	Business Plot	The Business Plot (also called the Wall Street Putsch and The White House Putsch) was an alleged political conspiracy in 1933 in the United States to overthrow the government of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and install a dictator. Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler asserted that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a fascist veterans' organization with Butler as its leader and use it in a coup d'√©tat to overthrow Roosevelt. In 1934, Butler testified under oath before the United States House of Representatives Special Committee on Un-American Activities (the "McCormack-Dickstein Committee") on these revelations. Although no one was prosecuted, the congressional committee final report said, "there is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient."  Early in the committee's gathering of testimony most major news media dismissed the plot, with a New York Times editorial characterizing it as a "gigantic hoax". While historians have questioned whether or not a coup was actually close to execution, most agree that some sort of "wild scheme" was contemplated and discussed.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_Plot&oldid=1073459185

	<i>Lancet</i> surveys of Iraq War casualties	The Lancet, one of the oldest scientific medical journals in the world, published two peer-reviewed studies on the effect of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation on the Iraqi mortality rate. The first was published in 2004; the second (by many of the same authors) in 2006. The studies estimate the number of excess deaths caused by the occupation, both direct (combatants plus non-combatants) and indirect (due to increased lawlessness, degraded infrastructure, poor healthcare, etc.).  The first survey published on 29 October 2004, estimated 98,000 excess Iraqi deaths (with a range of 8,000 to 194,000, using a 95% confidence interval (CI)) from the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq to that time, or about 50% higher than the death rate prior to the invasion. The authors described this as a conservative estimate, because it excluded the extreme statistical outlier data from Fallujah. If the Fallujah cluster were included, the mortality estimate would increase to 150% over pre-invasion rates (95% CI: 1.6 to 4.2).  The second survey published on 11 October 2006, estimated 654,965 excess deaths related to the war, or 2.5% of the population, through the end of June 2006. The new study applied similar methods and involved surveys between 20 May and 10 July 2006. More households were surveyed, allowing for a 95% confidence interval of 392,979 to 942,636 excess Iraqi deaths. 601,027 deaths (range of 426,369 to 793,663 using a 95% confidence interval) were due to violence. 31% (186,318) of those were attributed to the US-led Coalition, 24% (144,246) to others, and 46% (276,472) unknown. The causes of violent deaths were gunshot (56% or 336,575), car bomb (13% or 78,133), other explosion/ordnance (14%), air strike (13% or 78,133), accident (2% or 12,020), and unknown (2%).  The mortality estimates in the Lancet surveys are higher than in several other reports, including those of the Iraqi Health Ministry and the United Nations, as well as other household surveys such as the Iraq Living Conditions Survey and the Iraq Family Health Survey. The 2007 ORB survey of Iraq War casualties estimated more deaths than the Lancet, though it covered a longer period of the conflict. The Lancet surveys have triggered criticism and disbelief from some journalists, governments, the Iraq Body Count project, some epidemiologists and statisticians and others, but have also been supported by some journalists, governments, epidemiologists and statisticians.	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lancet_surveys_of_Iraq_War_casualties&oldid=1060035786

	Cosmopolitan Brands: graduate students navigating the social space of elite global universities	Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's analysis of the competition for economic, social and cultural capitals within educational fields, this article reports empirical research from 49 in-depth interviews with graduate students at four elite universities in the USA and the UK. It argues the brands of elite global universities work to reproduce social and cultural capital for a small cohort of elite students, and by doing so perpetuate and reinforce systems that privilege a select few. By drawing upon student narratives, our findings demonstrate the cosmopolitan nature of elite university brands. These 'Cosmopolitan Brands' are immersed in local and highly exclusive practices which reinforce wider inequalities of social class. We explore how individual students navigate their immersion and positioning within the brands of global elite universities; competing first as students at university before progressing to compete for power and status within global economies.	https://doi.org/10.1080/01425692.2021.1941763

Given the time and effort letter writers devote to supporting their students, the authors suggest this gender stereotype is likely due to unconscious biases.	https://voxeu.org/article/stereotyping-economics-job-market

	How narratives of racial progress create barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations	Despite statements in support of racial justice, many organizations fail to make good on their commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In this review, we describe the role of the narrative of racial progress-which conceives of society as rapidly and automatically ascending toward racial equity-in these failures. Specifically, the narrative¬†(1) envisions organizations as race neutral, (2) creates barriers to complex cross-race discussions about equity, (3) creates momentum for less effective policy change, and (4) reduces urgency around DEI goals. Thus, an effective DEI strategy will involve organizational leaders overcoming this narrative by acknowledging past DEI failures¬†and, most critically, implementing immediate and evidence-based structural changes that are essential for creating a more just and equitable workplace.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21000944

	The Mutually Reinforcing Cycle Of Poor Data Quality And Racialized Stereotypes That Shapes Asian American Health	The Asian American health narrative reflects a long history of structural racism in the US and the complex interplay of racialized history, immigrant patterns, and policies regarding Asians in the US. Yet owing to systematic issues in data collection including missing or misclassified data for Asian Americans and practices that lead to indiscriminate grouping of unlike individuals (for example, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Bangladeshi) together in data systems and pervasive stereotypes of Asian Americans, the drivers and experiences of health disparities experienced by these diverse groups remain unclear. The perpetual exclusion and misrepresentation of Asian American experiences in health research is exacerbated by three racialized stereotypes-the model minority, healthy immigrant effect, and perpetual foreigner-that fuel scientific and societal perceptions that Asian Americans do not experience health disparities. This codifies racist biases against the Asian American population in a mutually reinforcing cycle. In this article we describe the poor-quality data infrastructure and biases on the part of researchers and public health professionals, and we highlight examples from the health disparities literature. We provide recommendations on how to implement systems-level change and educational reform to infuse racial equity in future policy and practice for Asian American communities.	https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01417

	White Coats, White Hoods: The Medical Politics of the Ku Klux Klan in 1920s America	, summary:, This article explores the medical politics of the second iteration of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States. As eugenics gained a foothold in America at the turn of the twentieth century, the Klan embraced the latest in scientific racism to lend legitimacy to their cultural, political, and economic goals of white supremacy. Klan physicians in particular held a vested interest in preserving a racialized medical hierarchy and promoting reproductive surveillance in public health. By the 1920s, a symbiotic relationship developed between the organization and the medical profession. The Klan relied on its member physicians to lend professional respectability to the organization and scientific legitimacy to its agenda. In turn, affiliation with the Klan gave physicians an opportunity for career advancement and provided the muscle to intimidate professional and political opponents.	https://muse.jhu.edu/article/846640

	Conference demographics and footprint changed by virtual platforms	Conferences disseminate research, grow professional networks and train employees. Unfortunately, they also contribute to climate change and present barriers to achieving a socially sustainable work environment. Here, we analyse the recent impact of transforming in-person conferences into virtual conferences on improving diversity, equity and inclusion in science and engineering conferences. Factors including cost, gender, career stage and geographic location were evaluated. Virtual conferences demonstrated a clearly discernable and, in some cases, orders of magnitude improvement across nearly all metrics. On the basis of participant survey results, this improvement may be attributed to a combination of reduced financial and personal-life burdens. However, despite this clear impact, further development of virtual networking features and poster sessions is necessary to achieve widespread adoption and acceptance of this new format.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00823-2

We find that, in these states, 2.4 million workers lose $8 billion annually (an average of $3,300 per year for year-round workers) to minimum wage violations-nearly a quarter of their earned wages. This form of wage theft affects 17 percent of low-wage workers, with workers in all demographic categories being cheated out of pay.	https://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year/

	Academics of colour in elite universities in the UK and the USA: the 'unspoken system of exclusion'	This article explores the experiences of academics of colour in elite universities in the UK and the USA. Drawing on interviews with 34 respondents and using a critical race theory perspective, the findings indicate that academics of colour experience racism in the White space of an elite university. To counter the racism they experience, they develop 'safe spaces' in which they find empathy and support from other academics of colour. A key finding from the study suggests that despite having negative experiences in elite universities, academics of colour have contradictory feelings about their positions. They disassociate themselves from the racism by recognising the status and prestige associated with working at an elite university. This article suggests that in order for academics of colour to be fully included in elite universities, institutions must acknowledge racism and their own Whiteness to work towards cultural change.	https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2021.2020746

	Confidence, practices and training needs of people working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander LGBTIQ+ clients	Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander LGBTIQ+ peoples face an elevated risk for poor health and social-emotional wellbeing, suggesting that this patient group are likely to attend health and community services. However, the current practices of those who deliver care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander LGBTIQ+ peoples are unknown. Utilising mixed methods (survey; n = 197; focus groups and interviews; n = 56), we explored the current practices, confidence, knowledge, and training needs for working with Aboriginal LGBTIQ+ clients among Western Australian health and community service workers. Participants were predominately from the mental health and social-emotional wellbeing care sector. One-third of survey participants indicated that it was likely Aboriginal LGBTIQ+ peoples accessed their service. On average, participants reported high confidence and knowledge in working with Aboriginal LGBTIQ+ clients. Qualitative data indicated that staff struggled to accommodate what they understood to be the needs of clients who were both Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and LGBTIQ+, despite a willingness to 'get it right'. Findings provide the first-ever snapshot of inclusive practices among health and social support workers in Western Australia.	https://doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2022.2031298

	Why is it so hard to escape poverty? - Ann-Hel√©n Bay	Explore the paradox of welfare programs, and learn how they inadvertently reinforce generational poverty, and what we can do to fix them.    --    Imagine that you've been unemployed for months. Government benefit programs have helped you cover your expenses, but you're barely getting by. Finally, you receive a paycheck- but there's a catch. Your new job pays enough to disqualify you from benefit programs, but not enough to cover your costs. So how do we design benefit programs that don't penalize you for working? Ann-Hel√©n Bay investigates.    Lesson by Ann-Hel√©n Bay, directed by Avi Ofer.

	Do You See What I See? Perceptions of Gender Microaggressions in the Workplace	Although blatant expressions of sexism in the American workforce appear on the decline, many researchers note that discrimination is not disappearing but is instead becoming more subtle and ambiguous. Drawing from Sue et al.'s construct of microaggressions, which examines manifestations of prejudice ranging from subtle to overt, the present research provides the first known empirical investigation of gender differences in third-party perceptions of microaggressions against women at work. Undergraduate women and men read vignettes describing interactions between male supervisors and female subordinates, which portrayed potentially discriminatory supervisor behavior, ranging in explicitness from subtle to blatant. Results indicate that although both men and women perceive differences in microaggression explicitness, women tend to detect greater discrimination than men, particularly when instances are subtle in nature. Both genders expect microaggressions to generate more negative work outcomes as explicitness increases. We discuss practical implications of our research, including the importance of raising awareness of workplace gender microaggressions, especially its most subtle forms, and of developing supporting programs to help observers of discrimination, who may be more likely to be women in cases of perceived microaggressions against women. Future research directions for addressing the broad range of discrimination facing working women today are also explored.	http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0361684313511420
	Advancing Equality in Higher Education: an exploratory study of the Athena SWAN and Race Equality Charters	This one year project will explore aspects of good practice in institutions that have succeeded in securing accreditation at the first level (Bronze).	https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/crre/research/advancing-equality-in-higher-education.aspx
	Competing inequalities: gender versus race in higher education institutions in the UK	This article explores findings from two projects that explore the impacts and institutional experiences of the Athena SWAN (ASC) and Race Equality (REC) Charter Marks in UK universities. The article offers an important, timely and original insight into the ways that these two charter marks are shaping and influencing practice in universities. We argue that in higher education policymaking, there has been a privileging of gender over race in terms of addressing inequalities in higher education. Whilst acknowledging the persistence of inequalities in both groups, the data from our projects highlight a significant risk that gender and race inequalities become conflated in current equalities work. We argue that as a consequence of a logic of efficiency that drives Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to combine gender and race equalities work, and the privileging within this combination of gender, HEIs can publicly work towards equality and inclusion in general terms, without having to confront uncomfortable and deeply embedded practices that perpetuate White privilege in the academy.	https://doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2019.1642305
	Confronting White privilege: the importance of intersectionality in the sociology of education	This article explores how White privilege and a hierarchy of oppression have resulted in competing identities in which gender has been given greater importance compared to race. I argue that the sociology of education needs to adopt an intersectional approach that travels in different directions if it is to remain valid. The article examines how gender, perpetuated by White privilege, continues to play a key role in the positioning of Black and minority ethnic staff, students and pupils within a range of stereotypes that operate to marginalise their life trajectories. The article argues that if sociologists of education are unwilling to challenge White privileged populist discourses and their own positions of White privilege, then they will become complicit in maintaining a socially unjust status quo.	https://doi.org/10.1080/01425692.2020.1755224

	The relationship of race and gender to managers' ratings of promotion potential	The purpose of this paper was to examine the relationship of race and gender to managers' ratings of promotion potential for a sample of 1268 managerial and professional employees. Hierarchial regression analysis showed that controlling for age, education, tenure, salary grade, functional area, and satisfaction with career support, both race and gender were significantly related to promotion potential. Females were rated lower than males, and Blacks and Asians were rated lower than Whites. There were no interaction effects between race and gender.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/job.4030160409

	Promotion decisions as a diversity practice	Proposes that the promotion decision-making process contributes to the differential advancement of women and men in organizations. Compares the actual promotions of 13 women and 16 men at a company known for its diversity practices. Finds that bosses are more hesitant to promote women and require them to demonstrate personal strength and to prove themselves extensively before they get a promotion. Men are less likely to have promotions accounted for in terms of familiarity with job responsibilities and are more likely to have a high level of comfort with the boss as a reason for promotion. Strategies for addressing these differential dynamics include assessments of current promotion practices, modifications to human resource systems to increase accountability for the advancement of women, and coaching for decision makers and sponsors of high-potential women.	https://doi.org/10.1108/02621719510078867

	Reflections on the labyrinth: Investigating black and minority ethnic leaders' career experiences	Black and minority ethnic (BME) employees appear to experience more difficulty reaching senior leadership positions than do their white counterparts. Using Eagly and Carli's metaphor of the labyrinth, our aim was to give voice to black and minority ethnic managers who have successfully achieved senior management roles, and compare their leadership journeys with those of matched white managers. This article used semi-structured interviews and attribution theory to examine how 20 black and minority ethnic and 20 white senior managers from a UK government department made sense of significant career incidents in their leadership journeys. Template analysis was used to identify facilitators and barriers of career progression from causal explanations of these incidents. Although BME and white managers identified four common themes (visibility, networks, development and line manager support), they differed in how they made sense of formal and informal organizational processes to achieve career progression. The findings are used to theorize about the individual and organizational factors that contribute to the leadership journeys of minority ethnic employees.	https://doi.org/10.1177/0018726714550890

	Why People "Don't Trust the Evidence": Motivated Reasoning and Scientific Beliefs	In this commentary, we embed the volume's contributions on public beliefs about science in a broader theoretical discussion of motivated political reasoning. The studies presented in the preceding section of the volume consistently find evidence for hyperskepticism toward scientific evidence among ideologues, no matter the domain or context-and this skepticism seems to be stronger among conservatives than liberals. Here, we show that these patterns can be understood as part of a general tendency among individuals to defend their prior attitudes and actively challenge attitudinally incongruent arguments, a tendency that appears to be evident among liberals and conservatives alike. We integrate the empirical results reported in this volume into a broader theoretical discussion of the John Q. Public model of information processing and motivated reasoning, which posits that both affective and cognitive reactions to events are triggered unconsciously. We find that the work in this volume is largely consistent with our theories of affect-driven motivated reasoning and biased attitude formation.	http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002716214554758
